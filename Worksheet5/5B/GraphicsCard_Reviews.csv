"1","maxsun AMD Radeon RX","","October 28, 2024",4.3,"Works Great!","My old 1GB graphic card could just not keep up to the demands of making large image files for posters. It was causing frustrating delays, waiting for a refresh after every edit. At first I mistakenly bought an 8GB card I thought I could use to replace it, but it required a power connection I did not have. So I would have had to buy a completely new power supply. Yikes! Luckily my friendly neighborhood PC repair shop advised me to try this 4MB one, which didn't require a power supply connection. And it works great with little to no lag time after making edits to large graphic files. Recommended."
"2","maxsun AMD Radeon RX","Amazon Customer","October 13, 2024",4.3,"Worked dandy","Had my card go gimpy on me when the hurricane hit, it didn't detect my dvi monitor, slipped this in and I'm back to three monitors and happy.  I'm not a gamer and don't do graphics editing but for watching movies and browsing the web it works fine.  I mostly have terminals open, but they're darn good looking terminals."
"3","maxsun AMD Radeon RX","Michael Mckenney","April 1, 2024",4.4,"Works, but I ran into some driver issues","Needed a card to drive two monitors and this works good. Card is quiet.This isn’t the fault of the card itself, but I ran into a weird issue where Windows decided the driver in Windows Update was newer than the current AMD driver. The driver in Windows Update caused the card to not work correctly and throw errors on my system. Forcing Windows to stop overwriting the latest AMD driver however made things work correctly."
"4","maxsun AMD Radeon RX","ZX6R","September 28, 2024",4.2,"Works well in a office desktop envionment.","Used to replace flaky system video. Worked perfectly out of the box. Not used for gaming, however."
"5","maxsun AMD Radeon RX","SMH","August 30, 2024",4.2,"Good Card","Handles 3 monitors with no issues. Reasonable price."
"6","maxsun AMD Radeon RX","Lee stecher","November 17, 2022",4,"Doesn't work with some HP computers","I bought this card as an upgrade to a system currently running 3 monitors, intending to replace the HP AMD Radeon card that came with the computer with a faster one.  With the new card installed, the computer halted before windows boot with a condition of no video card detected, so (of course) no signal to the attached monitors.  After verifying that the card was properly seated and connected, and fan active, at least three possibilities remained: 1) the card was defective, 2) the card and BIOS are incompatible, or 3) that particular computer had a defective slot.  Possibility 3) was investigated by substituting the card into a second computer of the same model and configuration, again with no video card detected.Consequently, I reluctantly returned the card.  If the card was defective, I didn't want to keep it.  If the BIOS was incompatible with the card, this would require finding, then applying a BIOS upgrade, which might or might not resolve the problem.  If a BIOS upgrade fails, one possibility is that the mainboard is 'bricked', rendering that computer useless.  Neither of these outcomes was acceptable to me, so I returned the card.  Thanks Amazon.  Your easy return policy is one of the reasons you get my business.In most situations, a video card is detected during BIOS boot and operates with default low resolution until the OS boots, at which time appropriate drivers can be loaded.  I still cannot say whether this card is compatible with an HP H8-1240T, only that the card I received was certainly NOT.  I asked this question in the customer reviews section, but received no definitive answer, only novice level guidance.  Considering that new electronics are highly likely to arrive in working condition, the most likely explanation is that the card and that computer model are incompatible."

"8","maxsun AMD Radeon RX","Damiane LaCosta","December 7, 2023",4.4,"It over heats","It doesn't have a good heat sink on it so it over heats I had to put 2 big fans on it to keep it cool so it had a total of 3 fans on it so it wouldn't crash and that's on high resolution the ultra resolution it crashed right away that's how bad it overheats but besides that graphics are excellent."
"9","maxsun AMD Radeon RX","Traci Crews","August 30, 2022",4.2,NA,"If you have an older machine and if you are looking for a graphics card for ordinary use and maybe some light gaming, this is a great choice. It is listed as one of the top eight cards that does not require an extra power connection, as some older machines do not provide that option. I got this card on a big sale, it arrived the next day after order, clearly new, well packaged, nice and clean and solid, no issues. Easy to install, works great with Windows 10. I used an HDMI connection to a 4K monitor (resolution 3840x2140) which worked great. I did some light gaming, no issues. Card is not noisy. The card also has good connectivity options, HDMI, DisplayPort and DVI. So as long as you are not a super serious gamer, this is a great card. Mind you, if you shop around, you can find cards like the GTX1650, 1050Ti or RX 6400 which also do not require extra power and are much more powerful graphics cards. If the prices are comparable, it would make sense to get one of those instead, BUT if you can get the RX 550 on a good sale for much less than those other alternatives, and it meets your needs, it works great!  This card is best described as ""a solid budget pick"". Worth getting if you can get it for a great price, for much less than other higher performers. If you are a serious 3D gamer, then this is not for you, although you can play lots of games fine on it."

"21","KAER RX580 8GB Graphics","","January 31, 2024",4.3,"IT WORKS WELL for big open world games!","After having a 1650 for a couple of years, I really wanted something a little more powerful to be able to properly run, stream and play big open world games that have a lot of resources in them. Well, I can say after testing out Ark Survival, Palworld, Minecraft and others with the 2060, it does the job! The graphics don’t lie here. I was able to play games smoothly on the highest graphic settings. I got no lags nor frame drops.Now, here’s the thing. I was a little worried at first that I wouldn’t be able play with this card, because of the 8 pin connector that is needed to be installed into it. However, you don’t exactly need the 8 pin. You actually can just use a 6 pin and then easily squeeze a 2 pin making it 8. It’ll still work that way. Your power supply should definitely have both the 6 pin and 2 pin. If not, then you would have to buy an 8 pin connector or simply buy a new power supply. Plus, this card isn’t that expensive or at least it’s not in my budget, but if you’re considering on wanting to move up from the 1000s, get into streaming or playing in much better quality, then the 2060 I highly recommend. Of course we will have different PCs. Therefore, it really depends on what kind of graphics card your PC can take or not."
"22","KAER RX580 8GB Graphics","Amazon Customer","July 2, 2024",4.3,"very pleased with purchase","definitely a steal when it comes to quality and value. so easy to install no issues whatsoever, very quiet with a good amount of ram. the graphics on my computer run great and my gpu cooling stays right where it should be now. I love the white in color as it sticks out and makes my computer tower look cleaner and well put together. I have a gaming comp and can now run my main game while also surfing the web or opening other games with absolutely no problems.  definitely will purchase from this seller again"

This card is an absolute powerhouse. What's even more impressive is the affordability. I was pleasantly surprised by the value for the price. It's a budget-friendly choice that doesn't compromise on performance.Reliability is a big deal for me. It runs smoothly during long sessions, and I've not had any overheating issues or crashes. The cooling system keeps the card at a comfortable temperature, and it's surprisingly quiet.This card's versatility is another highlight. It's not just for gaming; it handles content creation tasks like video editing and 3D rendering like a pro.In a nutshell, the RX 580 8GB graphics card is an absolute joy. It's affordable, powerful, reliable, and versatile. As a happy user, I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an exceptional productivity experience without breaking the bank."

i grabbed this after my DELL 990 SFF w/ a r260 card was USELESS too try and play BFV, OR BF1.. tHIS GOT ME UP AND PALYING, I let this hang outside the case, grabbed a PCI extension cable, 500W atx PSU, (LEFT IT OUT OOF THE CASE) and a used intel i7-2600k or w.e.. all in i think for 168$ I got a older Dell too now play games I played on PS3... AND  i can surf web etc..I just got into building PCs... And i figured outquick that trying too build a SFF gaming rig CAN BE DONE.. But for now, im just using a full size case, after i built the dell.. I used this GPU, THE 35$ MBOARD, 13$ rgb fan, 35$ PSU, ram from the 16gb DELL, and HDD & SDD...Threw in a fullsize case i found in junk pile (AFTER I CLEANED IT UP)  grabbed a 13$ amazon special LGA115# AIR COOLER (THE WHITE ONE THAT STICKS OUT THE SIDE, 6X COOLER PIPES? IDFK.. And another cpl cheap fans, IDK, it saty down in the 90'* so guess they work also...Used  a old car alarm LED & MINI DPDT ON-OFF-ON toggle for the power on, and POWER/HDD lights..And hey, IT WORKS!.. the #idgafgamepc AINT PRETTY.  But man its alot faster, easier too work on then a SFF dell..I can play BF1-BFV with like hardly any interruptions. My brother says its plays as good as his $ALIENWARE used gaming laptop.. idk.. lolBut really happy with this GPU.. I AM NO PC GURU.. did not try overclock it.. BUT i didn't have too.. I just tuned the fan too come on sooner, adjusted the power use (it works fine with AMD ADRENALINE software)  and at pretty much stock settings with all the other cheap AMAZON COMPONENTS, except for CPU AND RAM) BUT.... I can play BFV pretty well.. think i had it set on 1280../720, and all graphics at low, filters off etc.. On medium/auto? it still works decent too.. But its best at low settings, Im perfectly happy way it plays and looks on low settings.. oh yea, It brought my PC BENCHMARK SCORE UP FROM A ""LOG (R270) -UP TOO A SAILBOAT""....  and for now, im gonna run it, while i search for my next plans and pc parts too build..the MB i used..https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BBMFSWY9?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsI noticed it this GPU Def likes a better PSU, and CPU, And a open case too keep it cool.. that goes without saying for PC.s  again, im a newb.. but not too building hardware and stuff..  And this thing has been running, nonstop for like 2 months now.. No problems.. I just made sure too add a case fan in back, too get heat in-out, then i added another, smaller 40mm? fan out of a dell on the front of my case also..The fan on the GPU is a little loud, when gaming, But honestly i dot mind louder fans on a PC.. and thats why i got goo soundbar.. Usually keep desktop away from screen anyway..IMHO.. Dont wast you time with othe GPU's, especially thos BS little 50-70$ ones.. Just grab something like this.. Its not the best.. But its awesome if your at a 100$ budget for a GPU..  and if you just wanta hookup, and start gaming, It will.. Im happy."

"41","MSI Gaming GeForce RTX","","December 9, 2024",4.7,"Solid card for the price","Running this thing with a 5600x, runs great. Plays RDR2 phenomenally and can play any modern game well. Too bad it’s mostly been put to use on Minecraft haha"
"42","MSI Gaming GeForce RTX","Amazon Customer","November 15, 2024",4.7,"Amazing!!!","The GeForce RTX 3060 is a fantastic choice if you're looking for strong 1080p and decent 1440p gaming performance without breaking the bank. I can play modern games at high settings with smooth frame rates, and it also handles creative tasks like video editing and 3D rendering quite well. The card runs quietly, and the power efficiency is impressive – I haven't experienced any overheating issues. While it's not the top-of-the-line for 4K gaming, it's a solid mid-range card with great value for gaming and multitasking. Highly recommended!"
"43","MSI Gaming GeForce RTX","David Hackbarth","October 23, 2024",4.7,"Great upgrade","Was a snug fit into my Dell Optiplex 7070 but it does fit. I'm very happy with the speed and clarity of the monitor picture. I can run MS Flight Sim at full speed and 4K. So many more games run at full throttle now. Not sure how it will do on your machine, but this works great on mine. The fans take a while to kick on which means the card isn't running hot. My CPU fan does seem to kick on sooner, though it doesn't get too hot. The OEM box isn't known to be a vent powerhouse, so it's not the cards fault. I did order another more powerful box fan, so we'll see how that goes when I get it."
"44","MSI Gaming GeForce RTX","C Tucker 0321","September 7, 2024",4.7,"Expectations Met","I ordered this product to run Stable Diffusion and continue the games I enjoy at the same quality as my AMD 6600. So far the 3060 has met my expectations. It was delivered quickly, was a fast swap in with my desktop and has worked without incident since. NVIDIA software runs well and the installation is pretty simple. All in all, a good introductory card for AI art programs while having respectable ability for gaming and graphics. Worth its price point of ~300 with tax and fees.Still, it is always advisable to make sure a card meets the requirements of what you want before you order."
"45","MSI Gaming GeForce RTX","!!!!! C5 !!!!!","August 21, 2024",4.7,"Amazing just great","No issues. Arrived so quickly. Installation was a breeze. I have no issues running any current games. There are some exceptions but for the most part this thing can handle just about any current game. No issues with overheating. I did buy this on sale but even for retail it’s a great pick for a GPU. You will have to upgrade eventually but it is worth the money and will last you a few years."
"46","MSI Gaming GeForce RTX","Luke K","December 2, 2024",4.7,"Works great for price.","It’s pretty good for the price. It works great in most modern games, and gets 100+ fps on high settings in somewhat demanding games. It stays cool in my case, and was very easy to install. The two fans, make it easier to fit in almost all ATX cases. The only caveat being, that for only a few dollars more, you can get the 4060, which is slightly better."

"51","MSI Gaming GeForce RTX","José gpe ocaña perez","February 28, 2024",4,NA,"We purchased a few of those for our lab to be used as GPGPU (mainly for deep learning).  We installed them in out HP Z4 workstations and they all work as advertised.  I am unable to assess how they perform for gaming or other graphical applications except to say that between computations they also drive our 2K monitors just fine.Just the above makes us satisfied customers, but to our pleasant surprise the card also accommodates our unusual power supplies.  About every PSU manufacturer and their mothers provide additional PCIe power using 8-pin connectors.  HP workstations however are different, for their PSUs provide 150+W of power through a 6-pin PCIe connector (which is normally rated at only 75W). The mentioned pleasant surprise is that this GPU happily accepts our 6-pin connectors and still works at full power, as opposed to other GPUs we tried which refuse to power on without an adapter cable.Overall these are great, inexpensive GPGPU devices which we can recommend."

Oui il y a toujours mieux, toujours plus chers.... mais pour moi elle comble tout mes besoins présent et futurs. Du beau,bon, et surtout pas cher en 2024 c'est rare.

Needed something better than integrated graphics to run some emulators (PS2, N64), a discreet GPU with low power requirements, low temperatures, low noise, and low cost. Considered a generic RX550, eventually decided on this one.Pros:- GPU is still supported by NVIDIA.- Windows 10 recognized and installed latest driver immediatelly, no issues.- First generation Maxwell, amazing energy efficiency, low temperature.- No external power requirement.- Affordable.Cons:- Fan runs at full speed all the time (two-wire connection to card).Fan shroud is easily removable. Replaced it with a couple of 120mm fans connected with PCI bracket. Benchmarked and stress tested, temperatures never reach 70C. I'm happy."

"101","maxsun AMD Radeon RX","","May 20, 2024",4.4,"Great Small Form Factor Video Card","I have a small form factor PC, the HP S01-pF2013w. It serves me well as a streamer/entertainment computer. Two issues though, it had slow USB (see my review on the FebSmart 2-port USB3 card) and I accidentally yanked the HDMI cord and damaged the built-in HDMI port. Not wanting to write-off the computer, I decided to try the Maxsun Radeon RX550 video card to salvage the situation.As advertised, the card was an easy fit in the PCI 16 slot. HP does not give much room between the slot and the power supply, but the Maxsun said it'd fit with only a 19mm space, and sure enough it did. That leaves a few mm's to spare, which I hoped would be enough for the fan to keep the card cool. The added HDMI and DisplayPort are unobstructed by the case.Just for grins, I decided to see how the stock Intel UHD 630 performance stacked up against the Radeon RX550. Using PassMark's PerformaceTest suite v 11.0 2D and 3D graphics tests, the Radeon came out the clear winner. It was visually obvious as the tests ran, I've included a pic showing the two results side by side.Power consumption was a concern, as was temperature.  It's a little computer with a small power supply. Using NZXT I was able to see the power consumption and temperature under idle, movie streaming, and hard-core 3D-rendering tests.  At idle, the Radeon only uses 4W.  While streaming, 6W at 126 F.  3D rendering pushed the card, it went to 24W at 172F. A little warmer than I like, but sustainable. My concern about limited airflow is gone.The only problem I had was the AMD software.  Windows 11 immediately recognized the card and it worked fine, but I later downloaded the AMD Adrenalin software just to make sure the full ability of the card was available. Unfortunately, that made it unstable - sometimes the screen would black-out and require a reboot. After I uninstalled the Adenalin software and only loaded the AMD Radeon driver it settled down and there've been no problems since.Verdict: The card works. There was a very noticeable improvement in performance compared to the Intel UHD 630, and the card uses very little wattage and keeps its cool. The Radeon RX550 will not win any awards and is by no means a graphics monster, but it does elevate an underpowered stock system from abysmal to mid-level graphics performance. I've no regrets."

The video was previously lagging and sticking when streaming UHD video, and when I checked task manager I found that the built in video GPU was running at 100% capacity. Dell recommended an AMD 550 half height card for this machine, so I purchased this one. It was easy to install, and I just downloaded the drivers from AMD's web site, which was easy to do (there were none in the box).  When I plugged the monitor into this card, the video quality was excellent, and task manager said that the video GPU was at about 50% capacity when streaming and displaying UHD video. Job done!  I should also not that the video card in the box was fitted with a mounting bracket for a full height slot, but the included a half height bracket which was easy to swap out. This was a good purchase - highly recommended."

It had near perfect traits, great fan curve with 0 fan speed at 30ish degrees or under and no very little fan noise under load. Loved it. But it left me wanting more and this popped up so I bought one. My benchmark score on heaven benchmark 4.0 went from 719 to 953(4k settings) while it scores a 1855 in 1440p high settings. A worthy investment considering the 60$ difference. My issue is with the fans and an intermittent display issue. The first 1660s I recieved had a fan noise when I spun it by hand gently. So I ordered a replacement and the replacement has a similiar grind noise but far less so I installed it. The fan seems quiet enough but it runs at 1200 rpm constantly. Msi afterburner seems unable to get control of the fans so I am currently unable to correct this to a 0 fan speed setting under 30ish degrees. That said the fan is pretty quiet at 1200rpm and other than that it works great overall and does struggle a bit in some games once 4k resolution is used.Edit: ok so the first time I turned this card on it worked initially for a few seconds, then it changed all the colors to green and purple then the picture dropped out and was not recognized by the screen. Unplughing the HDMI and plugging it back in fixed this.I assumed this was a first boot thing, but today it did the same thing on boot up.Update: This has not been an issue the last few days. So definetly intermittent."

The product comes in a simple box, but the physical quality of the card was better than expected.Just installed it yesterday and it was a breeze, didn't have an 8-pin connector but the product comes with an adapter so that's great. Having a 6 year old computer with an i7-4770 processor and 24 hours later I can say that my purchase was worth it, I've been playing Wo Long Fallen Dynasty at maximum settings with 80 fps on average and the card does not even reach 100% of its use so maybe can squeeze it in other more demanding games.It's nice to know you're paying for something that makes up for your investment."

It works great so far. It has only been a day but it has met my expectations. I’m running it on a 1440p ultrawide monitor at 144hz, linux system on an amd cpu. While benchmarking it will always switch back to 60hz but not while playing actual games or videos. No hiccups all day and runs 1440p video well enough.I’ll be updating throughout the month.9/20/24 update: Works great on dual 1440p displays. It runs 1080p video well but with multiple videos it struggles so you must close one. If you game you can have a music video playing no problem but don't expect it not to struggle where you have to shut down everything else in order to get good performance for your game. It will hiccup if you really push it but I didn't expect any different from a $99 card"

It’s not designed for intensive video needs. It's not going to work well for CAD cam or higher end gaming. Even though this card is for a narrow, space saving format, I wish it came with the smaller adapter if you needed to put it in a really short case.

I did my research and this was the perfect choice as I did not want to change the computer or the 400w power supply. It uses the 6 pin connector rather than the 8 Pin as well as PCI 3.0. Also it uses less power than other comparable model RX 580 cards. So this was good for my setup. I used the AMD drivers and the setup was easy. One note is that windows was apparently doing an update at the same time I tried to update the drivers so I go an error. Fortunately once the windows updates were done I was able to install the AMD video drivers without issue. So make sure you either disable or wait for windows updates to complete before installing the new AMD drivers. Since then everything seems to work well and I have my 3 monitor setup again. Hopefully it will last, as that will be the true test. Since I just got it recently I cannot say."

Like any other low profile card, you'll have the usual pros and cons, such as heating and space consumption. In terms of heating, it does get pretty hot, like any other video card, but It never reaches 80 centigrade.  As for fitting in the case, it was a perfect fit; I didn't need to move around wires, or make room inside.All of my games work beautifully, at a very good frame rate, much better than on a console.  The fans are very quiet, even under a heavy load.The 179.00 price tag was a tad pricy, but well inside my budget. I recommend it to any DIY PC gamer or someone on a budget."
"185","GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 3050","The Gracious One","May 16, 2024",4.6,"Small form factor builds; when you need more performance than a 1650","(Tldr: If you need more power than a 1650 in a small form factor office PC build, this is really one of your only options. Plus DLSS is nice to have.)To be frank, this GPU is not really great in terms of raw price to performance. If you're not limited by size and power consumption, there are muuuch better options out there for the same or lower price (used on eBay or Facebook) for amazing value. But when you have specific constraints, this card turns out to be a great value, especially as a new card competing against used ones. In the case of the 3050 6gb, I'm okay paying a premium for the high power efficiency and low profile form factor.From my personal testing, It has a little more power than the 1060 6gb, and a little less than a 1660 (non super). Considering you can pick those cards up for under a hundred bucks, you're paying around $100 extra with the 3050 6gb for just downsizing and lower wattage. In my case, I was fine with this, but you may not be.(Side note: I have a big gripe with the name. I feel like it should have just been called the 3040. It's a completely different card from the 3050 8gb)My constraints are a little specific, but not unreasonable. I have a cheap used HP EliteDesk 800 G2 (i7-6700) off of eBay for around 80 bucks. It only has a 240w power supply, so cards above the slot powered 75w ones are out of the equation.The 3050 6gb shines in the small form factor space, where you're restricted to slot-powered low profile cards. The alternatives are between an RTX A2000, AMD RX 6400, GTX 1050 TI, and a GTX 1650. (The 4060 low profile is a bit out of the price range)- The RTX A2000, if found used at around 200 dollars, would have been my choice. But the fact is that prices aren't anywhere near that for me at the moment.- The RX 6400, while a decent performer, only has 4 PCIe lanes, meaning it would be bottlenecked pretty bad by PCIe 3.0 (about a 15% decrease in performance from what I have read). In a used SFF office PC build with only PCIe 3.0, it's not suitable at all.- The GTX 1650 is cheaper than this card, but overall still not a great value. I could only find them about 20-30 bucks cheaper.- The GTX 1050 TI is really cheap, I could find them for about a hundred bucks less than the 3050 6gb. It's just much weaker than I'd like. In my case, I was not comfortable going slower than a GTX 1060, which both the gtx 1050 TI and the GTX 1650 are. It is a decent competitor, but the fact that the 3050 6gb has DLSS really sealed it for me. With these slower cards, I would be concerned I would not be able to run some games I like at a playable frame rate. With DLSS, I have the peace of mind that I have the option to punch above the GPUs weight if needed.To conclude:The 3050 6gb, while not a great value when compared to similarly priced full-sized alternatives, fills a great niche and is actually pretty competitive within it. For me, it was my only real choice.(A note about my EliteDesk build:I did have some issues with my specific build in the EliteDesk, as the card just barely interfered with the USB 3.0 header. I had to unplug it, and ordered a right angle connector that will hopefully fit. It also has some issues with the PCIe slot, as they only expect single slotted cards. Trying to fit a double slot card, I had to modify the case slightly by pushing the bar between slots back slightly. But now that it fits, it's running great and am extremely happy with my sub-300 dollar build!)"

I’d definitely recommend for anyone wanting something that’s not the absolute top of the line but definitely way better than lower end devices."
"187","GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 3050","Jack Kibort","June 12, 2024",4.6,"Very Nice","It has been a while since I purchased and installed a graphics card. I bought the wrong one initially as it required an 8 pin power connect. I needed a card that used the bus for power. This card is the most future ready card I could find. All powered by the bus! I learned PCIe14 is maxed out at 70 watts. This card can use 69.9 depending on the application running. I got it run Blender in my shop. Clean rays and vectors. Wonderful video. Clean fast rendering. Well worth the money."

Draws power from the pci slot itself.Works well with all new games and photo editors in high settings.ConsI have seen sometimes the display is blank. So make sure the card is inserted and secured properly. (Even though I secured it properly I see that the weight causes the card to detach from the slot partially. So better to keep the cpu horizontally.)"
