"7","darkFlash ATX Mid-Tower Gaming","M. J. Mincey","October 14, 2024",4.5,"A solid and versatile case for your next PC build.","This PC case proved to be an excellent foundation for my recent build. It offers ample space for most standard components, making it a great choice for those looking to create a reliable and functional system. However, it's worth noting that this case might not accommodate some of the larger motherboards or high-end graphics cards on the market. Space can also become a bit limited depending on the size of your CPU cooler.One of the standout features of this case is its versatility in terms of cooling options. It comes with three fans that can be mounted on the front panel for intake, or you can opt for a more comprehensive cooling solution by installing two additional fans on the top, one on the rear for exhaust, and mounting a radiator for a liquid cooler on the front.  The case even allows for fan installation on the bottom panel to aid in power supply cooling.Accessibility is another strong point. The removable front grill, top mesh panel, and screwless side panels make it incredibly easy to access and manage internal components. This is a huge plus for both building and maintaining your system.Overall, this PC case offers a great balance of functionality, versatility, and accessibility. It's a solid choice for builders of all levels, especially those who value ease of use and flexible cooling options. Just be sure to double-check component compatibility to ensure a smooth and successful build."

"22","PCCOOLER C3T500 ARGB PC","Amazon Customer","July 9, 2024",4.1,"Bang for your buck","Case is really easy to build in and is of good quality. The power button has a satisfying click and the mechanism for removing the side panel works great! The six fans that are included are awesome and can be controlled by Armor Crate software from my motherboard. Worth the price!"

First impressions I wasn't too happy seeing the absolute mess of cables inside the case. All of the fans have daisy chain cables for the fan and RGB control. One fan plugs into the controller for fan speed and RGB and it send that signal to the rest of the fans. It does get power from a sinlge SATA, so no power issues from daisy chaining all the fans and RGB. The case itself it nice, but it could use a small gap to accommodate cables when using a ATX board. All fans and all RGB work for me. I can control the RGB via a button on the case, or switch it over to let the motherboard control it.After building the computer, I am quite pleased with how it turned out. Even with the mess of cables (Nobody sees them anyways, right?)Going with 4 stars. I do enjoy the case, however I do believe the fans could be done in a much cleaner way that is easier to manage. Or maybe offer a version of this same case without the fans for a cheaper price to allow builders to go with their own choice of fan."

"41","CORSAIR 4000D AIRFLOW Tempered","","November 5, 2020",4.7,"Pretty solid case for a new pc builder","I recently built my first PC a few weeks ago and I chose my parts through a build guide on pcpartpicker (a great website I really recommend to anyone). I had no idea about what made a case good before ordering this case, but it was only $80 so I went with it as my case cause it looked nice. After having some time building the pc within it and using it, I can highly recommend it as a pretty spacious and airflow positive case.What I liked most about the case is the accessibility to mount fans all along the front top and rear of the case. I really don't like the idea of my PC getting too warm, so I got additional corsair fans to mount all around it to pull air in and out, which was very easy to install for this case.I love the finish of the metal, I got the black version, and I appreciate the matte metal finish, no blemishes were on mine, and the tempered glass is a nice tinted kind and also nice and hefty, so I like the overall build quality of this case. Very simple and effective and I would recommend it for someone who isn't going with a flashy pc build. Certainly would also look good with the all RGB lights design, but I didn't go that route.Another thing I hate is dust. Man I dislike getting dust on my electronic equipment, so what scared me about this case was that it has so much open areas for air to flow through the case, that dust would start to pile up inside. But I was excited to see that the front, top and bottom of the case all have dust guards that either clip in or are attached via magnets. So rinsing these dust guards off every so often will keep the inside of you pc nice and dust free, which I really enjoy. Also just to note, Corsair is going with yellow highlights on certain screws and their branding on one of the dust guards, but it is extremely small amount of yellow. Besides these yellow highlights the case is all black, but its something to keep in mind if you don't want any other color on your case. I suppose you could remove them if you'd like, but I enjoy the yellow tags.The cable management for this case is really nice, as there are many channels and openings from the front to back of the case to get your cables through and wrap up with ties. The case also comes with these nice corsair velcro ties that hold big bundles of your cables together with, and I appreciate that include as they were really nice and big.There are only three cons I can think of for this case, and they aren't very big:1. Some of the metal pieces, especially the pieces you will connect the exterior fans or radiator to, are really thin pieces of metal. While I like that they are thin, when you screw in the fans, you need to be careful cause they can be easy to bend. Again it's not even that bad, just be careful when screwing things into this case case the metal can be so thin.2. The big tempered glass door on the front sits very securely in place, but when you want to open the front of the case you need to unscrew the panel to the case and physically pull it out and place it somewhere else. This is the same for the back of the case too, but the back panel is metal. The biggest difference I wish this case had was that this glass panel swung out, so that you didn't need to take it off. Its still really well made, but I like my glass panel to be free of smudges, and when you have to handle it and take it off every time you need to access the inside of your pc, it is annoying having to physically take it off and get your fingerprints on the glass.3. The last thing is that the power supply with the cables is a really tight fit in the bottom of the PC, but its only tight if you have the hard drive holder in. I would suggest unscrewing the hard drive holder and taking that out when you are building inside your pc so you can easily get at the power supply. WIth the hard drive holder out, its actually pretty accessible to get to the power supply ports. The only con here is that its such a tight fit with the holder in, and trying to screw the hard drive holder in while all the cables are running up next to it into the power supply is really annoying and tight.Besides those three really small cons, I really enjoy the look, feel and accessibility of this case. I would recommend to anyone who wants that airflow quality and I like the look of it as well, really simple and clean."
"42","CORSAIR 4000D AIRFLOW Tempered","Amazon Customer","December 19, 2022",4.7,"Amazing case For my first build ever.","As the title says, this was my first PC build ever. That being said, even though I’m a building newbie, I still work in IT and am surrounded by tech, so I knew this case was a no brainer. Fantastic airflow, I mean literally amazing, it lives up to its name. Plenty of space inside for everything you need to do, and cable management was easy, like super easy. Only thing I could have wished for was:A: included a full set of front fans.B: make the top part actually removable, I looked at it and didn’t see a way, maybe I’m dumb, but it didn’t seem like there was a way to take it off, which became kind of a pain when I wanting to plug things in on the top.This is not a dealbreaker however, I just have huge hands that didn’t fit well in that tiny space to plug fans etc in and the cpu power cabling. I admit, this probably could have been done ahead of time and maybe this was just a newbie problem lol.That aside, this case is solid, definitely quality parts when buying from Corsair. I love how simple it is to pop off the front grille and filter, as well as how the front of the case and back side kinda snap off and on, it’s literally strong enough that it can’t accidentally fall off, but not so strong that it’s tough to remove (still use the screws of course for 100% protection of falling off).I never leave reviews on Amazon, but honestly, this case was just the favorite part of my whole build. It’s quality built, it’s got a nice dark black color and sexy style, and if you’re thinking about getting this case, DO IT, you won’t regret it at all I can guarantee that.Lastly I just wanna thank Corsair for making fantastic quality products, and being a name you know you can rely on, which is a big deal in a world where having reliable parts in a pc build is literally the most important thing. I hope everyone loves this case as much as I did."

"81","NZXT H5 Flow Compact","","November 6, 2023",4.8,"Awesome cooling performance and easy build experience","Summary: H6 is a perfect middle ground case between the historically cramped square cases and the newly emerging massive fish tank cases. Cooling performance is great and the price makes it a perfect balance of aesthetics, awesome performance, and lower price. Build quality is the standard amazing quality expected from NZXT cases.Pros- Super easy to build in! Tons of space for cable routing and management, especially in the back and at the top of the mobo where it’s usually a pain. Plenty of space for extra PSU cable length from cable kits or non-modular PSUs.- All panels pop off and on very easily. Incredibly easy to work with.- Case looks even better in person! The full glass gives a beautiful view of components.- Going from a glass front H510, I thought the full mesh would make my system much louder, but it’s just as quiet. That’s largely dependent on fans and their RPMs, but my same build in this case is quieter, perhaps from the angled fans being pointed away from where I’m sitting.- The recessed fan slots in the bottom of the case both look interesting and also seem to work exceptionally well. I’m seeing 7 degree (C) GPU temp reduction under load compared to my prior H510, but there are also multiple more fan slots on this case. Whether it’s the lower 140 slots or the front, I’m stoked to see that much of a GPU temp reduction given how intense games push GPU these days.- My favorite little detail is a small hook between the back exhaust fan and the top of the case. This allows you to route that cable safely so wire interference is not a concern.- I thought this case was going to be a lot wider of a footprint than it actually is. It is wider than my prior H510 due to the PSU being behind the mobo instead of beneath it, but it’s totally worth the extra space given the cooling performance and it doesn’t feel or look too big like some of the larger fish tanks cases are.Cons- Honestly, I haven’t found a true con yet. Biggest con I can think of is that the included fans come with a pre installed splitter. That splitter is too short to run to a mobo header, but it’s plenty of length if you have a Kraken or other NZXT RGB or Fan controller."

This case starting off arrived 8 days ahead of schedule so I was thrilled off the bat. I have never built a PC because and was upgrading from an old dell office PC so I knew very little. The cable management was beautiful as well as the very simple stupid proof instructions. I was able to quickly assemble the PC and start actually using it almost immediately. The RBG lights are truly beautiful and very bright as well as the very sleek front power button display. This case is one I had saw very well recommended all over the internet and know I understand why. The fans it came with kept the case chilly alone and wasn't very loud, the room inside of the case is amazing you have all the room to assemble your parts and secure them. The bang for your buck is also amazing I felt like I wasn’t getting scammed for having a well built beautiful piece on my desk. The build quality is very high as well nothing was plastic or cheap Ik the slightest. I am over joyed with the quality, simplicity, and beauty of this build overall. (Perfect for first time builders)"

Here’s what stood out to me:Design & AestheticsThe case looks awesome with its minimalistic design and integrated RGB fans. The RGB lighting is bright but not too over-the-top, and it’s easy to customize using the included software. The tempered glass side panel shows off the internal components really well, making it a nice centerpiece for my setup.Airflow & CoolingAirflow is the standout feature of this case. The mesh front panel and spacious interior allow for great air circulation, which keeps my components cool, even during long gaming sessions. It comes with two pre-installed fans, but there’s room to add more if needed. My RTX 3070 and i5 11400F stay at solid temps without any heat issues, which is exactly what I was hoping for. Before this case my GPU was at 65 idle and 81 gaming now it’s 35 idle and  65-70 gamingBuild Quality & Ease of UseThe build quality is impressive. The case feels sturdy without being overly heavy.

I decided one night after having a beer or two that I wanted a bit of a nicer case to show off my ryzen 7 7800x3d and rtx 4090, so I ordered this one. Let me tell you, this case BREATHS. In my old case my processor and gpu sat in the 70 degree range, in this one they're sitting in the 50s. The case is sturdy and well built. Assembling a pc inside is very easy because everything comes apart. There's tons or potential to modify it how you want. I personally put a 360mm aio up top and white rgb fans everywhere they would fit, including 2 140mm fans in the bottom. It's incredibly easy to cable manage and has a wiring tray with velcro straps so when you decide to change a component you're not cutting all your zip ties. 3 slot cards and atx motherboards fit and look great in the case."

It offers ample space for most standard components, making it a great choice for those looking to create a reliable and functional system. However, it's worth noting that this case might not accommodate some of the larger motherboards or high-end graphics cards on the market. Space can also become a bit limited depending on the size of your CPU cooler.One of the standout features of this case is its versatility in terms of cooling options. It comes with three fans that can be mounted on the front panel for intake, or you can opt for a more comprehensive cooling solution by installing two additional fans on the top, one on the rear for exhaust, and mounting a radiator for a liquid cooler on the front.  The case even allows for fan installation on the bottom panel to aid in power supply cooling.Accessibility is another strong point. The removable front grill, top mesh panel, and screwless side panels make it incredibly easy to access and manage internal components. This is a huge plus for both building and maintaining your system.Overall, this PC case offers a great balance of functionality, versatility, and accessibility.

"141","Sevenhero EMBL Micro-ATX Gaming","Amazon Customer","December 5, 2024",4.3,"nice small fish-tank style case","Sevenhero EMBL Micro-ATXOverall, I really like this case.I had concerns seeing as I never heard of this brand, and when I was looking, there were practically no reviews. But I haven't had any issues with this case and am happy with the purchase and would buy again.I was looking to assemble a basic office pc and didn't want it to just be a blank black box, but also didn't want to spend too much on aesthetics since that wasn't its purpose. This struck the balance pretty well. At under $70 for a glass case, with 3 pwm rgb fans, I was a little surprised by a few extra I didn't notice right away. For instance, the 2 fans at the back are reverse style, which in even more premium cases isn't always a feature. It also has reflective stickers on the hub of the fans, which create a little infinity mirror. Both are minor things, but I enjoyed seeing. The fans also are daisy chained together, so you only need 1 header to power all 3, and 1 rgb header for all 3.The case is easy to work with, but then again, my build was basic. If you plan to make use of the hard drive bays, you may want a modular power supply. No real issue with a regular psu when the hdd/sdd bay is removed though, which is what I did.The case can accommodate a relatively big cpu cooler no problem. One of my pictures shows a noctua NH-U12S and it fits.The black mesh base is fairly see-through. In one of my pictures, you can see the white sticker on the power supply. You can't really see the wires or anything else from any reasonable distance, but if your psu has white on it, you may want to black it out."
"142","Sevenhero EMBL Micro-ATX Gaming","Devin","March 24, 2024",4.7,"Decent case if you can get it at the right price","This case has been all over the place with price in the past three months.  I was able to purchase it with a limited time discount at $75 which made this case excellent for the money.  But it seems to be normally $119 which puts it in the same range of much nicer cases.  I would only consider this case if you can get it around $90 or less because of its limitations and budget construction.I was looking for the smallest case with full glass sides that could fit an ATX motherboard.  This one does but you have to get creative with installation.  I was able to fit most of the lower motherboard connections under the board but only by running the wires prior to installing it on the standoffs.  One exception was the 3.1 USB connection which I had to run out, turn and then parallel to the board.  The issue here is that you can only then install two 120mm or 140mm fans at the bottom as the USB cable would interfere with three 120mm fans.  This is of course dependent on what headers you have on the bottom of your motherboard.  An mATX motherboard will not have any of these issues.Another issue with using an ATX board is that a 280mm cooler may not fit correctly because of the top chipset cooling fins on most motherboards.  I had to mount my 280 forward in the case and only 4 of the 6 top mounting screws went into the proper slots for AIO mounting.  If you use a 360mm or 240mm cooler, you will not have this problem.Speaking of fans, I did not use the included fans because I wanted some reverse flow fans for the bottom of the case but only for the aesthetics.  The included fans would be fine if you are doing an air cooled design as they could be mounted in the top and not be mounted reverse direction of the included reverse flow side fans.These issues are really minor considering this case is shorter and smaller than any other full glass sided case that can fit an ATX board.  Just do some careful assembly and be prepared to remove the motherboard a couple of times as you run cables.The overall case construction is adequate.  Rivets are visible and I had to add two small, but hidden, pieces of felt to keep the side glass panel from rattling.  Paint finish is attractive but is a bit soft, screws will leave a mark if tightened even normally and then removed (AIO installation and subsequent adjustment due to fitment).  The rear expansion card slot brackets are the worst offender, as another reviewer mentioned, you have to carefully bend and break the slot off and once you do there is no putting it back.  At the price point they are asking normally, this really should be a separate piece that can be removed and reinstalled. Overall this case feels like a $80 case, not a $119 case.  There is no HDD activity light, something that I really think is silly to leave off a case even at $80.  Finally, there are no gromets for the cable openings, which is okay for the price I paid but at the normal price they really should at least include two for the main openings next to the side intake fans.Airflow is excellent.  I am running an overclocked i7-12700 and a 4070 super and temperatures are not the limiting factor here.  I have two 120mm intakes in the side, two 280mm in the bottom pulling in and up and the AIO pulling out on the top.  Lots of nice positive pressure and the case is not restrictive.  No issues here at all.The other thing that I really like is that the USB ports and power/reset button are on the bottom right of the case.  This is perfect for a case that sits on a desk on your right hand side.  I can access all of them from my chair without any effort.  If you plan on putting this on the floor or under you desk then access to them will be an issue.  This really is a super small ATX case meant to be placed on a desktop.At $75 this is a solid four star case.  If they included gromets for cable openings, were able to stop using visible rivets, put a bit of felt on the bottom side of the case where the glass panel connects (or tighten up the slot it fits in to stop rattling) and most importantly had normal removeable and replaceable expansion slot brackets, I'd say 5 star.  I really like the aesthetics and configuration and the super small size.  If you want the absolute smallest ATX case with two full glass sides this is it.  But at over $100 I'd start looking at something like the H6 flow which doesn't have the ATX build quirks and has better case construction."

As for everyone, I was scared to see what I received from the limited amount of reviews there were. And I was not disappointed at all. I got the case with 5 fans already prebuilt into it, and bought an additional one (only 10$) for an exhaust. These fans run beautifully, quiet and hook up to my Nzxt Cam rgb settings with no issues at all. This is a sturdy case and made very well. Plenty of space, beautiful open glass exposure. I’m so happy I went with this. There unfortunately was a scratch on the inside of one of the glass panels but this is my first ever build so I wasn’t picky. I was determined for a mainly white build. There’s plenty of room in the back for all the wires and the power supply unit. I am really happy with this purchase and it was such a great price too, it really can’t get better than that. I would highly recommend this to anyone. Beginner or expert. (Don’t pay attention to the noise in the background of the video, I have a box fan going lol)"
"144","Sevenhero EMBL Micro-ATX Gaming","Mack","February 5, 2024",4.8,"Easy to use, great USB placement, and beautiful.","Great case. Fans that came with the case are super quiet and look beautiful and lots of room for everything you need. I love that the power supply goes behind the motherboard so it makes cable management a breeze. Will say, the only minor thing I'd add to make this case A+++ is to lift the motherboard slightly off the bottom (ATX board) so that a few holes can be accessible to hit the bottom of the motherboard for cabling. Fans on the bottom do a decent job of hiding the cables like header/RGB but as the builder, I know they are there. I would highly recommend this case as an alternative to NZXT's H9 elite (too pricey for what you get plus fans) and also, the USB header being where it is instead of on top the case is a brilliant move.Overall out of 100, i've rate this a 98/100 just due to there not being holes underneath the motherboard for cable management."

"167","KEDIERS Micro ATX Tower","Porter","April 29, 2024",4.3,"be aware, the fans are argb but are powered by a molex connection. You cant control the fan speed.","i wouldnt have bought this case if i had known about not being able to control the fan speed. Its loud af with 7 fans running wide open. horrible deal. dont buy. the case itself is nice just dont buy with the fans."
"168","KEDIERS Micro ATX Tower","Jessie","January 29, 2024",3.9,"Broken fan on arrival, had to turn most of them around","all 6 working fans blow the air out normally, instead of the optimal intake anyone can find via google. the 7th fan, arrived with the plastic fanblades completely out of the unit, and popping it back in didn't fix it. it is plugged in and does not turn on or spin, only the LEDs work on it.Update: it took an hour to get the screws to cooperate, but brute forcing the fanblade back in got it to work, and I now have proper airflow after manually readjusting the fans myself. decent case, but left a lot of work to the user to fix."

One of the standout features of the Corsair 5000D is its exceptional airflow design. The front panel features a large mesh surface that allows for unrestricted airflow, keeping my components cool even during intensive gaming sessions. With ample room for additional fans or liquid cooling options, this case excels in thermal performance.The black variant of this case exudes elegance and sophistication. The tempered glass side panel showcases the internal components beautifully, allowing for a clean and organized build. The cable management system is well thought out, keeping the interior clutter-free and enhancing the overall aesthetics.The mid-tower design strikes a perfect balance between size and versatility. It offers ample space for high-end components, including large graphics cards and multiple storage drives. I appreciate the tool-free drive installation, which makes setup a breeze. Additionally, the modular design of the case allows for customization and reconfiguration to suit different build requirements.Corsair has clearly put thought into the assembly process. The case comes with clear and concise instructions, making it easy for both beginners and experienced builders. The well-placed cable routing holes and ample space behind the motherboard tray make cable management a straightforward task.Despite its impressive airflow, the Corsair 5000D also offers a degree of noise reduction. The included high-density sound-dampening material on the side panels helps to muffle internal sound, providing a quieter computing experience.Very good tower, perfect for your computer.I highly recommend it."

Airflow is the word here. It's obviously the focus of this very capable case. If you want maximum fresh air - this is the case. Six intake fans. Four exhaust. The readings speak for themselves. I have a Ryzen 9 5900x that is supposed to stay below 90C. I have yet to see it go above 65. I have a great CPU cooler in the Noctua NH-D15 as well.That is the bottom line. You can keep reading about this build, and what I put in it and why, but you don't need that info to know this is a quality, SOLID case with many options, and lots of attention to detail. Go online and watch ANY review of this case and you can see the accolades from people who evaluate this stuff all day, every day. This is a popular case for a reason. It's a good one. You'll read below about my inexperience with this kind of case and build, yet I had no issues just putting the whole thing together intuitively.The cable management compartment is real nice. You can be neat as you want to, wires showing are wires showing. This case makes it real.easy to hide everything.The single drawback to this case? (If you 2ant to call it that...) It's HUGE. It's just.... Big as hell, and I can't find a piece of furniture made for PC cases that will fit it. It's sitting on the desk right now, while I decide how to deal with this. Make sure you want all this case. It's BIG. 20""X20""X9.5"".The rest of this beast is centered around an EVGA RTX 3080 FTW3 10GB, and 64GB 3600MHz, and a Samsung M.2 980 Pro Gen4. The whole package smokes. There are a couple monitors hooked to it now, and I'll buy a proper gaming monitor soon. It will also be used for VR stuff.This is my first gaming rig build. I am an audio guy. I've built many high powered PCs in the past (though it's been a couple years since I have built one for my own house, from scratch,) but nothing like this. The biggest concern I've ever had for graphics is being able to run dual monitors for recording studio software. Memory, processing power and tons of storage is the name of the game in audio PCs. The audio gear that interfaces with those is all outboard, and typically can move from one PC to an upgraded one no problem.The case made this easy. A whole bunch of modern parts I'd never used or installed wasn't an issue or hard. No crazy compromising or going without something I wanted. The case is huge and fits a LOT.This is a whole different thing. I've never built a PC with a case window, lights, or this many fans. I've never had such an insane CPU cooler, or one of these 'second cpu' Graphics Card monstrosities. And I've never had my own machine with an M.2 drive.Oh. And this isn't REALLY for me. It's for my 13 year old son. He is into animation and gaming in these (sandbox?), Minecraft / Roblox user created worlds and characters. The rig he was using was an i3 with a 4GB GPU. Worthless. He is now blown away and I can't keep him off it..I got the white case and some other white elements, like the side intake fans have white LED rings, and the MOBO has some white and silver elements. I also did one ""mod."" (Picture/ Video)  I put in two chunky, round, white led lights in the case and wired them to the power and HDD LED connections on the MOBO. It's a cool effect. There's lots of room for lights or any other stuff you want to put in for decor."

The inclusion of three high-quality AirGuide fans and the option for additional cooling solutions ensures that your system remains cool even during intense gaming sessions or demanding tasks.The case's build quality is impressive, with a sturdy steel construction that not only provides durability but also minimizes vibrations and noise. The tool-free design makes installation a breeze, and the spacious interior offers plenty of room for large graphics cards, multiple storage drives, and effective cable management.One of the standout features is the attention to detail in cable management. The 5000D Airflow comes with a generous amount of tie-down points and ample space behind the motherboard tray, allowing for a clean and organized build.

The built in cable management system is phenomenal.  Glass is nice and thick.  The case is very sturdy.  My PC build was very easy and fast with this case. Please type of extra space also for future expansion.  Would highly recommend."
"186","Corsair 5000D Airflow Tempered","Diego Emiliano Cornejo Peña","October 4, 2022",4.5,NA,"The 5000D Airflow. I don't think I've ever worked with such a great case in all my years.Honestly this case is full of good ideas and good execution, from dust filters to fan mounting to rad support. I squeezed a thicc 360 Corsair XR7 into the front a 240 XR5 up top and this thing runs cool as ice even when my 3080 is pushing 400W and my 10600K is flying high at 125W.Excellent cable runs in behind and plenty of depth behind the panel make this a dream for cable management. Lots of room to expand, even vertical GPU mounting is possible.If I had to have a gripe or two.... Maybe a fan splitter would be a nice addition, and some more space up top. I really wanted to mount another 360 rad up top, but I just couldn't squeeze it in. If the top was maybe a half inch higher and the case a half inch longer it would fit two XR7s. Also the included Corsair fans are garbage like usual. I swapped them out for some grey Noctuas up top and Cooler Master RGB Sickleflows in the front.Otherwise this case is brilliant. The glass is gorgeous, the paint is good quality, the plastics are slick. Good job Corsair, you earned my money this time."
