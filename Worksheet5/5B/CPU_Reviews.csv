"1","Mini CPU Intel N5095A","Amazon Customer","March 16, 2024",4.2,"Small, Fast, Easy, Low Cost!","This little PC was packaged nicely, super easy to install, I needed a real HDMI port for my Monitor and it had one. Has plenty of USB ports and a real 1G network port. Everything worked out of the box even my off brand USB WebCam. The network (I used the hard wired option) actuuslly ran at 1G. THis little box supports 2 HDMI montors if you need it. This is the perfect little PC for browsing and almost any every day Windows task. Totally quiet and way lower power than my last PC.  I am not a gamer so can't comment on that. Honestly my expectations were much lower I am way happy, I wonder why I put this decision off so long"
"2","Mini CPU Intel N5095A","David Bernstein","May 28, 2024",4.1,"Nice compact size","Works well & is very small in size as I set it up next to my Windows 10 desk top PC. It runs fast so I'm happy with it. All my computers are windows 10 & can't be upgraded to 11 so I wanted a computer (11) that I can use on internet after Oct 2025 when MS stops updating 10. I didn't want to spend a lot so this fit the bill. I don't play games so I can't speak on that capability. Seems to be good quality.I bought a second one two months later (same model as the first) since it was on sale for a lower cost. This second Mini was a little harder setting up I think because the 2nd one manufactured earlier then the first one I got and perhaps MS may have made changes to the 11pro system (the first one had a ser# 500 higher then the second one).  Both mini are working fine & I don't have any issues."
"3","Mini CPU Intel N5095A","Wes","July 28, 2024",4.2,"Excellent computer, setup a little weird","If you are not a programmer it won't make much difference to you, but you will not be able to use WSL on this without changing the bios settings, so if you need this to write code or use secure applications, be prepared for some minor bios tweaking. Other than that, it is unbeatable for the money, especially if you value a small and convenient size."
"4","Mini CPU Intel N5095A","Robert A. Hansen","March 3, 2024",4.2,"A really neat minipc","I had heard of the mini Mac. I saw these about 2 months ago just as the New Year started. And I really wanted to get when it looks so sleek and neat. I watched a number of YouTube videos about these things. I weighed the pros and cons of them. I purchased one Thursday night and it arrived yesterday. I'm quickly loading it up with all my favorite software. I actually find that the device works pretty well. I haven't had any issues with it since yesterday afternoon. I actually think it's a neat thing to have. The performance is like they said it is. I find that when I turn it on it is quiet I don't even hear anything because it's all solid state. It boots up really fast. I have the 16 GB 1 TB model. You can get this all the way up to 64 GB 2 terabytes. The USB ports are labeled. The HDMI ports are labeled. There's a USB c drive on here or plug in thing. There's a Kensington lock on here. Even a slot for a mini or a micro SD card. It's easy to set up and it has all the features of Windows pro. I had to tweak some of the settings to my liking. But it's working and I was able to get it going in about maybe 15-20 minutes. you can plug all of your favorite peripherals into it. I plugged two USB 3.0 multi-port devices so I can get more out of it. I plugged in my 8 terabyte and my 4 TB external hard drives and they work just fine. I also plugged in a CD DVD ROM recording thing. And it does just fine"
"5","Mini CPU Intel N5095A","Gary Gray","October 26, 2024",4.3,"Had to change my review.","At first I thought this was going to be a good computer, but in less than two days it failed while in the process of getting my applications installed. It had been working fine then froze up. When I rebooted, the video circuits had quit operating properly and would not allow a second monitor to function nor allow for any adjustments to the main monitor, which only worked in base mode. I hate to say but I am sending it back for a refund. It was aggravating to install all my software and get the thing just about fully loaded and then have fail. Lesson learned. Buyer beware."
"6","Mini CPU Intel N5095A",NA,"June 25, 2024",4.5,"works great, but it took a while","I can see where the bad reviews might come in, some applications are a little challenging to download but it’s not the computer it’s the app.I installed 4 printers in my computer a sublimation printer, a Roland Bn 20, uninet 250i and a regular hp printer. It was a little challenging. I also was worried it would not support it because it was a mini computer and I could not find anything online that someone actually purchased one with this kind of printers I have, but it works flawlessly. I also have a hub and I  am very happy with the mini pc and I would highly recommend. Browsing is really fast a very simple computer and I could not be any happier and relieved it works and I don’t have to return it."

"21","Intel Core i5-12600K Desktop","","November 27, 2024",4.6,"Reliable and Powerful Processor","Solid choice for anyone looking for a reliable and powerful CPU. It handles multitasking with ease and performs well across various applications. I've been using it for a while now, and it's never let me down. It delivers great speed and functionality, making it perfect for both work and gaming. Definitely worth the investment"
"22","Intel Core i5-12600K Desktop","Amazon Customer","December 7, 2024",4.7,"Genuine part, works great","I purchased this to rebuild my HTPC, which had outdated hardware, firmware, and software.The chip came in well packaged, with good instructions, and was easy to install.My computer is now updated, and the speed is great. I am using this primarily as a home theater computer."
"23","Intel Core i5-12600K Desktop","Quoleo","September 9, 2024",4.6,"Performance CPU for Emby Media Server","I built a rack mount server to run Emby and chose the Core i5-12600K because of the integrated UHD 770 graphics that handles transcoding video very well. I am very pleased with how this CPU has been performing. It transcodes using Intel's QuickSync like a beast. I tested up to 15 4K to 1080p transcodes simultaneously and not a hiccup. The 12600K is an older 12th gen processor but is still a performer depending on use case. I compared the 12600K to the i7 12600K and performance difference was marginal, so I settled on the i5. I am very pleased."
"24","Intel Core i5-12600K Desktop","Bill V","November 21, 2024",4.8,"Great CPU for the price","Got this when making a budget build. Have not been disappointed and think it's a great choice for the price point."
"25","Intel Core i5-12600K Desktop","Derek Noll","November 11, 2024",4.8,"Good quality, easy setup","Bought this CPU because I needed to update my motherboard BIOS and didn't have time to wait multiple days for a cheaper CPU to ship.It didn't come with a heatsink, but it worked well enough that I ended up keeping it around in case my 14th-gen i9 quits on me. Would buy again."
"26","Intel Core i5-12600K Desktop","jake","September 14, 2024",4.8,"No worries like the 13 &14th gen","I bought this to replace a 12400. Works great as I knew it would. I now have two computers rocking a 12600k. I was going to get a 13 or 14th Gen, but didn’t want their problems. This is plenty fast. Works well for productivity and gaming."
"27","Intel Core i5-12600K Desktop","Dan Toler","January 23, 2022",4.8,"Pain in to setup. Nothing but a headache. I wish I would have got a different cpu.","No support for deepcool heatsinks, wasted time modifying it to fit, (it does work, but wasted a couple hours on a process that should take 5-10 minutes). I have never had so much trouble get a cpu to run in linux. Good grief, I’m a computer expert by trade, and intel should have waited to release this series. I know the competition is tough, but I definitely wont go and buy another one of these. I thought it would be a good investment. I may have damage my motherboard on install, as the cpu slip out of my hands and banged up against the socket bent some pins. It was so hard to get running under linux, graphics support is nonexistent, i can only the XE2 new graphics cards will be more of the same since these are based on that Technology. You can find a work around on Phoronix for the graphics problem, however the image on linux sucks it’s more pixelated than i would like. I would like to mention I needed to my rx 580 to get this thing running as the Linux OS didn’t recognize the GFX chip on the cpu. And with the way the situation is with gpu’s I’m lucky to have had one at hand. The Bios also doesn’t show on my pc correctly if you use the onboard Intel graphics, its cutoff . Also the hard drive was not recognized with the motherboard but it happed two motherboard asrock and gigabyte. I had to install a new elilo version to get the efi to work. What can i say the performance is good, but runs hot 120 watts at the cpu when doing multithreaded task like compiling the kernel. It does that fast but Ryzen 12 core does it faster and with less power 95watts. It’s hard to say this was an upgrade, my head hurts whenever an issue comes up with this cpu. Now after about month of use the gfx is acting weird, it starts to fragment / pixelated and gets stuck. I’m sure intel knows and I probably should have just gotten a kf series instead because it is so bad now i just left the dang rx 580 in the system. Maybe I’m not the only one, I’m sure a class action lawsuit is in the works. I have not been able to enjoy this since I purchased on day one. I would have returned this but then I would have to return the motherboard to another vendor and i sure don’t want to go to that trouble. I fortunately got ddr4 version so I reduced the amount of ram in the computer and will use it as is until it dies. Hopefully after this crypto boom I’ll be able to snag a ryzen 5th gen combo for cheap. My intel can fix this but it will be years before this happens. They are too busy playing catch up. The power efficiency is terrible and the whole experience is about as bad as it gets. Save yourself a headache and get something comparable like a 3700x or better. This is not worth the price or painful install procedures. I just thought it was ridiculous coming from intel, didnt they create the PCs we know of today??? Did i mention the bios was cuttoff on left and right edges so you cant read the functions??? I’m surprised Intel engineers released this, more of a sample than a final product. Buy something else, did i mention the cheapest motherboard sets you back around $200, so $500 into this ordeal is not a good experience, could have purchased 2 sets of used ryzen 7 8 core cpus and motherboard for the same money and ultimately gotten more performance in power usage and cpu. That’s my thoughts on this product."
"28","Intel Core i5-12600K Desktop","Bman","July 23, 2024",4.6,"Bigger CPU","The i5 12600k is quite bigger (like the one you put in your mouth). I mean, bigger than older Intel CPUs. I have no regrets or concerns about the power of this CPU.It is enough for hard gaming (valorant, APEX, Dota 2, league of legends) in terms of online gaming. I am pretty sure it will performs very well with musician software too, because the owner of this computer is a guitar rock player and gamer.I love intel CPUs, I'm a intel fanboy from Ecuador."

"45","AMD Ryzen 7 5700X","Gustavo L.","December 4, 2024",4.4,"The best 5000 series?","When considering a cpu you REALLY need to ask yourself what your going to use it for and what type of user you yourself are. And do your own research, DO NOT just listen to every youtuber telling you one model is better than...If your looking for a solid performer in all aspects,  a cpu that's EASY to keep cool and doesn't require much power then the 5700x is perfect.If your trying to push everything to very peak and looking for the best fps in games and your fine with dealing with the extra power and heat management needs then consider the 5800x or 5800x3d.Something to note however is that in terms of gaming the 5800x only achieves 5 to 10 higher fps (test comparisons done with a 3060 gpu)However the 5700x actually performed better in several multicore tests.The 5800x requires nearly double the power which in turn means it generates much more heat. If your looking to build a quiet, easy to cool machine and only getting 100fps on your favorite game versus 106fps is fine to you then consider the 5700x. Especially if your on a budget since you can easily go with cheaper cooling options.Match it with the right ram and a good gpu and it should last for years to come.Random fact that no one else likes to mention.The Ryzen 7 5800x came out in 2020... they didn't realease the 5700x until 2022"
"46","AMD Ryzen 7 5700X","CAPN","July 9, 2024",4.6,"Great CPU","I bought this CPU for an upgrade to my home server, which was using a Ryzen 3900x from my main build.I ended up going with the Ryzen 7 5700x because it has 8c/16t which is adequate for my home lab use cases and it supports ECC DDR4; I have this paired with 64 GB of Kingston ECC UDIMM DDR4. At $160 (with the interest free Amazon payments), this was a much cheaper option than buying a second Ryzen 9 5900x for this machine. The IPC gains over Zen 2 are noticeable and it performs very well in my home lab use cases. I've been using this with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and Windows 11 Pro without issues for the past month or so I've had it.I recommend this CPU if youre looking for a cheap in socket upgrade from a prior AM4 Ryzen CPU or if you're looking to build a new budget gaming PC. As I mentioned in my 5900x review, now is a great time to scoop up deals on the 5000 series CPUs along with cheap AM4 motherboards and PCIe 4.0 NVMe storage.Overall, this CPU performs as I would expect it to, is a solid value at ~$160 and it does really well in my home lab use cases. 5/5!"

Gaming, music stuff and windows related things are all running much better now.Two huge thumbs up, glad I could get another cpu upgrade in before having to up grade my motherboard and ram, as I didn't have the money to do all that.

For some reason it didn’t come for 10 days and I had completely forgotten about it. Slapped it in when I got it and the performance difference was IMMENSE. Great CPU quality. Great speed.

"62","AMD Ryzen 7 5700X3D","Amazon Customer","June 28, 2024",4.8,"Fantastic am4 upgrade.","TL/DR: Processor good, computer go zoom.I built an am4 system a few years back, when graphics cards were hard to get, and cpu/motherboard prices were on the rise. I built on a bit of a budget, so I didn’t go crazy on the processor, and snagged a 3600. A reasonable amount of ram, decent graphics card, and the best motherboard I could get, so I wouldn’t be stuck without room to upgrade/expand later. Well, here we are, it’s later. I needed a bit of a bump to better enjoy the occasional game, and run some of my 3D modeling software a touch smoother. I didn’t want to commit to a full new build, but with the price of the 5800x3d vs some am5 platform options, I was a bit torn. That said, I didn’t have any need to go overboard, because my use case wouldn’t push a 5800x3d to its limits. Enter the 5700x3d, and at a price just over $200. The 5700x3d does great with everything I throw at it. It runs super stable, the temperature is well managed with most decent coolers, no issues with games, or any rendering software. This is a great way to get a nice performance bump across the board, and buy a few more years of use on your am4 platform. If you’re looking for an upgrade, this is a pretty solid one. Obviously, the price might be better or worse depending on when you’re reading this, so ymmv.HOWEVER. If you’re building a new computer, just go am5. Unless someone is giving you parts, or an amazing deal on something, it just doesn’t seem worth it outside of being a fantastic upgrade for current am4 owners. But I’m just a guy on the internet, giving my 2 cents."
"63","AMD Ryzen 7 5700X3D","Paul","May 7, 2024",4.8,"Upgrade from the Ryzen 1700 is MASSIVE.","I've got a near 8 year old system that was still running a Ryzen 1700 and GTX 1080, on an MSI B350m Mortar motherboard. The first gen Ryzen had some issue with utilizing 3200mhz ram, I think the official max supported was like 2677mhz, so my RAM was always underclocked. Naturally after so long I was getting the itch for an upgrade.I didn't want to spend $1000 on an AM5 build just for my GPU to be bottlenecked and be forced to buy a $1200-2000 GPU, especially when my GTX 1080 is still surprisingly relevant by today's standards.Fortunately my OLD MSI b350m motherboard put out a BIOS update for this processor which literally made it plug and play. Dropped in the new CPU and after taking a little while to boot up, everything ran like normal. After enabling XMP my RAM immediately went to the rated 3200mhz, no fuss, whereas my old Ryzen 1700 would make things very unstable after about 2733mhz.Depending on your motherboard there's some special options in the BIOS you can modify to make the chip run a lot cooler. I am using a 240mm AIO water cooler but the temps were approaching 90C on prime95. I enabled some of the undervolting options and that was making temps top out around 75C while boosting!I haven't had the opportunity yet to thoroughly test it in games yet, but the games I have played so far have been running noticeably better. That is of course on top of the obvious increase in speed in any other task compared to my Ryzen 1700. On top of all this I can consistently push it over 4GHz turbo on 1.15v whereas my 1700 was underclocked to 3.2GHz around 1.2v to be stable.My intentions with this processor was to utilize the new 3D Vcache technology to ""future proof"" my AM4 system for at least a few more years to give GPU technology more time to develop and hopefully have some breakthrough where GPUs are better and not so much more expensive nowadays. Beyond the fact the m.2 drives are overkill for most tasks and it's still hard to find AM5 motherboards that have USB 4.0 slots.In conclusion, this upgrade resulted in my RAM being able to be run at expected speeds or better, a much faster processor and much better gaming performance with lower power draw. It has allowed me to squeeze the last bit of life out of my AM4 board and give it a facelift, for the price of about $300 all in for the CPU, liquid cooler and paste.In other words I saved about $1000-3000 in not having to upgrade to the AM5 platform that is still in it's infancy, and get to stay on the time tested AM4 platform while the newer platforms work out the kinks and there's better GPU options as well as USB 4 standards etc.If you're on the fence about making the purchase, go for it. I bought this when the price dropped to $229 and at the time that was a $80ish discount from the 5800x3d for a processor that uses a lot less power for maybe a 5% difference in performance. If you care more about your power bill and heat being generated by your computer than a 5% increase in performance, and you're staying on the AM4 platform, MAKE THE PURCHASE!"

It doesn't have PCIe 4.0, but you are not likely to need that unless you are managing a data center, that is why AMD made the consious decision to limit this to PCIe 3.0... you simply don't need PCIe Gen 4 whether you understand why or not.  The pricing of this CPU at under $100 is totally right, and it feels good to go with this and not be stuck with an Intel motherboard, given the problems with Intel's CPUs.  This AMD CPU has 12 threads, which gives you a good ability to game and stream live... I think this CPU is great for a practical/value gaming system."
"86","AMD Ryzen 5 5500","Matthew Carl","September 10, 2024",4.8,"Budget Friendly Gaming CPU","For several years, AMD has consistently put out solid products in the CPU space. Many would argue that their Ryzen series processors, de-throned Intel as the premier CPU manufacturer, and I would tend to agree in most circumstances. The value and performance from this CPU is fantastic. You can regularly find this processor for under $100, at the time of this review, it can be had for $80. You can't hope to find value like this from Intel, at least not currently. Released in April 2022, the Ryzen 5 5500 is a great choice for someone who is looking for a budget friendly and performant processor, whether it be for gaming or casual computer use. It's got 6 cores and 12 threads, which means that it's more modern architecture makes it viable for longer. A TDP of 65w(watts), means that it's a relatively easy processor to power, so you won't need a high-powered rig to run it, and the inclusion of a cooler in the box, means you have everything you need to put it into your system and go. The Wraith coolers from AMD, are nothing to write home about, but it's additional value for your money that you don't find much nowadays. It's on the AM4 socket, which AMD will be supporting for at least a few more years, although they no longer release new CPUs for this socket. It's pretty clear that AM4 still has some solid staying power, so I would expect some decent longevity with it. All in all, I'd highly recommend this CPU. My fiancé got it for her first desktop, to do gaming and media consumption, and we've both been very happy with it."
"87","AMD Ryzen 5 5500","Adam","July 17, 2023",4.8,"It does it's job.","For me CPUs like this, which are budget CPUs are mostly about the price.  For $100 USD or less this is an excellent buy.  If it's more than that, uhhhh.  I'll take the 5600 for $130 Bob.While this is a Zen 3 CPU, it's not PCIe gen4 and you should be aware of this before buying.  It's not the same line of CPU that most Zen 3 CPUs which are Vermeer.  This is Cezanne.  There are 3 Cezanne CPUs, the other two are OEM only, meaning they only come in a PC you buy from a company that makes PCs like Dell, etc........  For the most part this isn't a problem because it's a budget CPU, however if you pair this with something like an AMD Radeon 6500 XT which only uses 4 PCIe lanes to connect to the CPU, you'll get bad performance.  So don't do that.Otherwise as long as you pair this with at least an 8 PCIe lane GPU it works fine.  You take a tiny hit in GPU performance but not enough to worry about.The bigger hit comes with the NVMe drives, especially in 2023 and going forward.  There are now MANY NVMe disks that are a lot faster than 4GB/s, and to give as simple explanation as I can, a PCIe lane is a serial data line.  The way a PCIe device/bus works is by grouping a certain amount of lanes so that you get the speed of a single PCIe lane times the number of lanes you have.  Any NVMe disk has 4 lanes.  It also means the port you plug it into along with what it connects to (CPU, motherboard chipset) has 4 PCIe lanes that it will connect with.  So, you get 4 PCIe lanes. So now you need to know the data speed for each lane.  For PCIe gen3, the speed of each lane is 1GB/s.  For PCIe gen4 the speed of each lane is 2GB/s.  So, with this CPU, the best you can get is a data transfer rate of 4GB/s to an NVMe disk.  That's it.  The newest disks coming out the end of 2022, and 2023 can hit speeds near 9GB/s.  Now, most data transfers to/from NVMe disks can't run at that speed.  However many disks can run many data transfers faster than 4GB/s, so that means a CPU that runs PCIe gen3 is slowing down modern NVMe disks that can run gen4 or now gen5 speeds.  But that's not a statement that has a clear meaning, because just because a disk is called gen4, it doesn't mean most of the data transfers to/from that disk will run at the full bandwidth of PCIe gen4 x4 lanes = 8GB/s.  Most gen4 disks rarely hit that speed if ever.  Only the most expensive ones do.  BUT once again many will run different types of transfers above 4GB/s.So that's the description of what it means to have PCIe gen3 when dealing with modern NVMe disks.  You're going to slow down some of the data transfers, not all, depending on how fast (which also means more expensive) the disk is.Yes for a general purpose PC build this is good enough and it's a low cost option that's really good at $100 USD or less.  However if the price of this starts to get closer to the Ryzen 5600, I'd rather buy the 5600 because that's PCIe gen4 which is as good as it gets with an AMD AM4 motherboard."

Most recently, 2016, I was able to go into a Fry's Electronics in Phoenix and buy my system components one by one,  and Fry's would assemble and burn. Although I bought a high spec Dell laptop 18 months ago, I knew I needed to get a new PC given the age of what I have been using, which by the way was SOTA in 2016. I looked at various online PC builders, but wasn't able to find what I wanted. Then I stumbled across this machine on Amazon. The i9 processor and 32GB RAM, the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GPU (disabled onboard GPU in BIOS), the 960 GB SSD, 4 TB HDD storage, a high end wifi/bluetooth card and advanced antenna, and fun cool lights which I can't bring myself to fully turn off. There is an auxillary fan that has its own switch, separate from the advanced CPU cooling, the GPU fan and the case fans, all of which are perfectlly quiet. When turned on, this auxillary fan is VERY noisy. But, thankfully, you can turn it off. I guess you use when maxing out CPU and power consumption. When off, it is whisper quiet.I bought this machine because I wanted a high end workstation that didn't need to be at server/enterprise specs. Benchmarking this using the free, online utility UserBenchmark, this machine performs like a total beast, at the very top of the CPU, RAM, GPU, HDD and other benchmarks.So, definitely buy this machine from this company, or any of their future configurations/offerings.

This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen."

However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailers—Best Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fans—Avoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouse—achieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methods—increased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this date—4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!Note:Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.  I can get bus latency down to under 50NS but need to decrease core clock to locked 5.8GHZ to stay at safe voltage....

I run heavy multi processs workloads, and so I installed the 12700 and it worked as expected for the first few hours. But, after a few hours the PC would reboot or shutdown due to the CPU hitting 100 degrees and thermal protection kicking in. After a week or so of messing around in the BIOS I did manage to finally get the CPU to be stable. Then I realised on Amazon that Intel CPUs were dropping in price so I bit the bullet and purchased the i9, and I am very glad I did. The i9 CPU stays 20-30 degrees cooler than the 12700k, and sits at 70o hen running very heavy workloads (using all cores at 80-100%), it will chomp away for 24 hours in this state. I haven't had to change any BIOS settings to get it stable, although obviously buying a K processor means I will start tinkering with it soon enough. All this is to say that the processing is 30% more performant with my use cases, and the CPU runs 30 degrees cooler. I am extremely happy I bought this, and now the Intel stability issues are resolved (BIOS firmware causing excess voltage) I would recommend this chip to everyone who wants a hevy workload CPU. I do also have a AMD 7950x in another machine and I dont see much performance differrence between them. If anything, the Intel chip boots to OS 10 times faster than the AMD, and it also supports more PCIe Gen 5 lanes, so if I was to choose I would get the Intel."

I built a super slim mini ITX build in a Silverstone Raven small form factor case. It is about the size of the old Dell desktops my company used to use. The case is a lot less bulky than typical PC builds, but for a minimal build with this processor it was perfect. According to benchmarks on UserBenchmark this processor performs nearly exactly the same as my laptop processor. My laptop processor is a quad core i7-6700hq. This dual core processor performs just as well as my laptop quad core. I put in a GTX 1050 TI graphics card which also near exactly matches the performance of my laptop's GTX 970m. With this processor I build a desktop that can do everything my laptop can do, but for a third of the cost. Pretty awesome low end processor!One thing I forgot to mention is that it comes with its own stock fan/heatsink. Had I known this I wouldn't have bought the $40 noctua low profile fan. Since you can't overclock this processor you really don't need a better cooler than the stock one. I bought an i7-6700K last year and that didn't come with a fan or heatsink, so I didn't think this one would. If you have an i5 or i7 processor I'd buy an aftermarket cooler. For an i3 like this one just use the stock. You really aren't going to see any performance benefits."

For those that don't know many games even today really only use 1 core at a time. This puppy is extremely low wattage to begin with (lower wattage= less heat generated) and hopefully longer system life. This i3's single core performance is up there with $350+ xeons and i7's. So for the price it's very impressive as long as your games can only use 1 or 2 cores at a time. For a bit of education if you do ctrl+alt+delete and it looks like a game or process is using all cores equally it is usually a lie. It is in reality one core getting hammered at 100% then jumping to the next one in the series. You have to actually research to figure out how many cores your game actually uses at one time. If you aren't a gamer and for some reason are building a desktop for casual internet use like watching youtube videos and browsing the internet an i3 like this is probably the best thing for you to buy. Especially since it will actually save you money over a beefier processor that you will never actually fully utilize anyway."

These are both with reasonable curves set for the fans and pump, erring on the side of it being quiet. I'm sure it would be even better at with a more aggressive curve.This is the first time I've seen my processor hit 4.9ghz on a single core since I got it in 2021, and that's without undervolting.I have never had temps this reasonable, I honestly chocked it up to the 5950x just being hot.I think the offset mounting really makes a difference, and the vrm cooler is a nice touch.My only complaint is that it is a little bit tricky to mount by yourself. It's very easy to push the backplate off when adding the bracket, and the spring tensioned two screw design isn't the simplest, but I did get it on without making a mess of the paste.The pump is essentially inaudible at 50% speed, and the fans at full speed are so much quieter than my x73 was. They do hit a lower peak rpm, but they are clearly moving the heat through the rad, which is also like twice as thick as the x73.  I do sort of miss having a coolant temp reading, but hey, the less software the better."

Because of this, I could not eliminate the pump whine because I could not adjust the speed, so it was two problems in one that could not be resolved.The Arctic Liquid Freezer III, on the other hand, I have running silently for normal operation, and even running games where it ramps up, there is no noticeable pump whine over the fans I have in the case. It also is an offset mount, which helps my ARM5-based Ryzen 7 7700 run very cool. I've never hit above 65 C even at full load testing. Typical idle temperature is around 33 C with almost no noise whatsoever running two 120mm bottom fans, one 120mm rear fan, and the AIO on the top.The only issue with installation was, as is noted almost everywhere, that screwing in the AIO block onto the processor is a bit difficult.

It works great and runs very quiet compare to the Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE that I recently installed in my sons PC it was also a lot more delicate and difficult to install.  The instructions are a guided website that is mostly pictures which as fine for 90% but in my opinion really needed a note to explain what to do with the VRM cable. It turns out it was for a VRM cooling fan and plugged into a standard fan header. The instructions for mounting the  water block look as simple as put it in place and screw it down. It took us 45 minutes and smeared the thermal paste all over the place (I highly recommend a thermal paste guard/contact frame).  The issue is the screws barely protrude and the spring mechanism points the slightly outward so getting 1 of them to just catch was hard enough but getting the 2nd 1 to catch took an uncomfortable amount of force pushing down on the block and screw to angle it correctly coupled with a lot of luck. I know this is to get even force on the block once it is installed but was so much more difficult than simple spring loaded screws like the Peerless Assassin had. The radiator took time due to a fan direction and getting around the case limitations but over all installed easily enough. the problem is the radiator fins are as soft as clay and get dinged up if ANYTHING even looked at them funny. I think the dings were mostly cosmetic and invisible behind the fans the front grill of the case but I was still annoyed and the Peerless Assassin finds were not nearly as fragile. in summary, the price was great (I payed $90 - wish I had spent another $20 for RGB), the installation was frustrating, but now that it is done I am quite happy because this thing is really quiet and the CPU stays cool.

Temps are not an issue at all when paired with an ID-COOLING 240mm AIO and some Noctua thermal paste. Overall, great value for the price, and a great option for the AM4 platform."

For productivity it works wonders as well, probably a factor with other parts in my system but boot times are lightning fast, google tabs load quickly, there is so much more. If you are on a bit of a budget, you should get this CPU."

Great upgrade for anyone with AM4 socket motherboard who doesn't want to move onto the next gen yet. This CPU will definitely still be capable for several more years as it's speed is great and AMD is still supporting AM4 chipsets for the foreseeable future."

No es el procesador mas nuevo pero funciona a la perfección para trabajar zbrush, photoshop y maya. Tiene un consumo eléctrico aceptable y esta corriendo muy frío con mi disipador thermal right silver soul."
