"1","HP 14"" Ultral Light","","September 10, 2023",4.1,"Great value, love the simplistic design","Very simple and functional yet it has all of the essentials without any of the gimmicky frills. Maybe it takes a $300 laptop so I don't have to deal with built in Alexa-enabled something, HP-specific ports, fingerprint scanner, and other stuff I don't want or need. They don't try anything fancy with this one which for me is a positive. Plus it's TKL keyboard which really should be the new norm. Does not have a backlit keyboard which is a slight miss but for the price it's not a huge deal.You can take it out of S-mode easily and remove a lot of the addons and you have yourself a perfectly functional Windows machine. Despite the lower-tier hardware it still starts up very quickly if you make sure you don't have too much bloatware. Sure it's a little slow at times but if you're using it for day to day tasks it should be fine. Battery life seems very good, the laptop is also fairly lightweight as well. What more could you ask for at this price point."
"2","HP 14"" Ultral Light","Amazon Customer","November 20, 2024",4.1,"Nice laptop","Reviews for laptops can go either way but I took a chance with this one because of price and time as I was about to start school and needed a new laptop. So far, it’s been great. I use it for school only so I don’t use a lot of space/features so I can’t speak to those. But from using it for school, it’s been a great purchase. The battery life is great, the speed is fast and I definitely got my money’s worth out of it."
"3","HP 14"" Ultral Light","ben","May 30, 2024",4.2,"locked into MS S mode, be careful of the bait-n-switch","5/31/2024Update: Revised review to 4 stars from 1. If you're lured to these by an Amazon flash offer, and begin to compare other options/offers, be sure to throughly compare the descriptions. Or you'll purchase something you didn't want. If you find this out after you set everything up and there is no problem with the computer itself, you're stuck with it. The other issue I had was the inability to exit Win 11 S mode. After hours of trying the standard method and several youtube videos with complex work arounds, I gave up. Today I decided to express my feelings in the MS Edge search window and I received this response from Copilot. (posted in the picture above). I post because subsequent requests produced different results. This work around worked quickly and was a three step fix. Have exited S mode and am happily running Google Chrome. Plus all my Google info and files from my broken laptop ported over. One last note: this is definitely a computer for students. It is priced reasonably considering post Covid greedflation prices. It is comparetively slow and not for use use for gamers. I will keep it as I need a computer for research and writing papers.5/30/2024-My laptop broke. Needed to complete paperwork for a project with tight time lured by ""Deal"" for laptop with 4GB ram 64 storage Bluetooth, Wi-Fi. $169, 12hr delivery.  I figure it was good enough to get my work done. At the site several other options were available with the same features and more memory. All had delivery dates of 1=2 days except 1 with 8GB ram, 192GB storage for $259 w/ $40 coupon, Thought extra memory and storage was worth extra $90. Computer arrived. It took an 1-1/2 hr to do updates. When I tried to download Chrome to work in Google docs {state recommended for changes}. This computer is locked into MS S mode blocking download of apps not in MS store. After spending 2hrs trying  different S mode exit directions is was resolved to doing the work on my Samsung S20 which took 3 hours to do 1 hr of work. This computer doesn't have Bluetooth, is extremely slow. MS locks y into using Edge in a worse case scenario than they did with Explorer 25 yrs ago. Don't be lured by the free1yr of Home 365. Cannot return because I used it and is technically not broken. HP is obviously returning to the days of cheap low-grade Compaq. Clearest example of Greedflation. It also moved data from broken laptop creating what will be hours of scrubbing to sell at 1/2 price on Ebay."

"5","HP 14"" Ultral Light","Dennis Sandberg","July 12, 2024",4.4,"10/10","I recently purchased the HP Newest 14"" Ultralight Laptop and let me tell you, it has been an absolute game-changer for both my student life and my business needs. As someone who is always on the go, I needed a reliable laptop that could keep up with my busy schedule, and this laptop has exceeded all of my expectations.Let's start with the design - this laptop is sleek, lightweight, and portable, making it perfect for carrying around campus or taking to meetings. The 14"" screen is the perfect size for both work and play, and the Intel Quad-Core N4120 processor ensures that everything runs smoothly and quickly. The 8GB of RAM and 192GB of storage (64GB eMMC + 128GB Micro SD) provide more than enough space for all of my files, photos, and videos.One of my favorite features of this laptop is the 1 Year Office 365 subscription that comes included. Having access to all of the Microsoft Office programs has made it so much easier for me to stay organized and productive. The webcam is great for virtual meetings, and the HDMI, WiFi, and USB-A ports make it easy to connect to external devices and accessories.But what truly sets this laptop apart is its incredible value for the price. I was a bit hesitant at first because of how affordable it is, but I can confidently say that this laptop is worth every penny. The performance and quality are on par with laptops that cost twice as much, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.In conclusion, if you're a student or a business professional in need of a reliable, efficient, and affordable laptop, with amazing battery life, look no further than the HP Newest 14"" Ultralight Laptop. It's a 5-star product that will truly make your life easier and more enjoyable. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!."

Got it for great value on Prime Day so worth the little money I paid. I didn’t want or need an expensive laptop. Plus it’s lightweight."
"7","HP 14"" Ultral Light","Wanderer","December 5, 2024",4.1,"Great with Apple Gestures","If you’re used to Macs this is a great laptop for you. It has a lot of the same hand gestures, making life so easy lol. I also really like the keyboard feel in general."

This seems to be a great little laptop for general web browsing, school work or even remote work. Good size screen, brightness is good. I had zero issues installing Google chrome, not sure why it was an issue for anyone else. When I first started it up it did take a little time to get going as it needed to install updates but once installed it seems to be fairly quick. Reading reviews its not great for gaming but that’s not an issue for me since I have no intention on using it for gaming. I’ll write a follow up in a few months but happy with this so far!"
"23","HP 14 Laptop Intel","Tom Robertson","November 25, 2024",4,"Does exactly what I would expect.","It's not an amazing laptop, but for $200 what are you expecting? Runs web great, has a long battery life."
"24","HP 14 Laptop Intel","Amanda Kulfan","November 19, 2024",4.1,"You get your moneys worth","It’s a computer for $100 give or take. You really can expect only so much out of it. It does the trick. Only issue to me its that it’s a pain in the butt do download google chrome on it, which, I wouldn’t care about using necessarily however apparently a lot of programs online only work with chrome. Not a dealbreaker though. It’s a little slow but she gets the job done. If you want a computer to blow you away with how great it is, spend some more money and get a better one. BUT if you need a nice little laptop to get the essentials done, this will do the trick. But if you’re going to get all nitpicky then invest some more cash in a different computer."

"41","ASUS E410 Intel Celeron","","October 30, 2022",4,"GOOD BUY, esp for battery life","[REVISED Apr 6 '24 for storage issues - see end.]I bought two of these. The oldest is 18 months old and still going strong (although the screen isn't as bright as the second one, which I never use except to update it). My first one was just $150USD and now the same model has gone up by $40USD. It's still a great buy.You can also find a nifty review on YouTube by the user First Look.***PROS:1. Excellent battery life. It really does last for 8+ hours provided you're not doing anything intensive like accessing a high-capacity USB HDD. Keep in mind that a bigger screen, a bigger built-in HD will drain your battery faster.2. Weighs 2.8 pounds (under 1.5KG).3. Still a great bargain at the current price (I bought two for $140 ea. over a year ago).4. The 14"" LED screen works well for most purposes. I've noticed that my oldest one (18 months old) is losing brightness. But for the price, I'm not worried since I only anticipate 2-3 years' use out of it.5. Built tough like a tank - compare to Dell.6. Comes with Windows 10. The update to 11 is free. You'll lose some built-in HD space, but it's worth it.7. Built-in webcam and mic. I've used them for Skype and WhatsApp - not great quality but if you're traveling they'll do fine for those or Zoom.***CONS:1. Only 2 built-in USB ports. You'll need a USB hub. Note that a typical (unpowered) USB hub will not take a large-capacity USB drive. So if you want to run two of them, a powered USB hub helps, e.g.: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BZ46YVRK/ [NOTE: I actually daisy that with a standard USB hub and plug the former's power connector into it. It doesn't short on me.]2. The built-in keyboard and mouse pad are minimally useful. For traveling, consider a small external pointing device and a roll-up keyboard. (Which is yet another reason to have a USB hub.)3. Very little useful space on the built-in solid state hard disk (about 38GB available for apps and data). A USB HD will fix that problem; for traveling use large-capacity memory sticks. IMPORTANT: you have to turn off Windows' restore points otherwise your on-board space will deteriorate quickly. Be sure you back it up when you get it (you'll need a USB CD drive or a bootable memory stick). I keep very few ""data"" files on it. [Keep the ESC key pressed for boot options.]4. Not terribly fast, the processors are rated at 1.1GB. Supposedly it can be overclocked but I've never tried. It's a nice addition to a desktop, but most certainly NOT a replacement.5. You need to know your way around Windows for the best results. For ex., I had to create my own batch file to run MSPaint. (It's designed to prefer MS Office 365 which I refuse to deal with. Consider Apache Open Office - it's free.) Even tho' the processor is 64bits, I've been pleasantly surprised by how many 32bit applications seem to run on it.6. The built-in speaker sound quality is **dreadful**, but one can't complain given the size and weight. For traveling consider bluetooth headphones/speakers or USB speakers.7. Keyboard keys aren't backlit, but then the keyboard isn't very useful as I noted. When I'm in bed w/ wife, I just use an external backlit keyboard (lots of choices here - I like: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BRMCPPZ5/ ... that said, if you're on a plane and the lights are off, you're probably just going to have to live with your cell instead ... there's just not enough space on a tray table. For my money, it's not worth paying more for a built-in backlit keyboard.8. Will not hibernate (see below).***HD SPACE NOTES (built-in HD):1. I get the best results from setting PAGEFILE.SYS to a min of 2000 and a max of 3000 (roughly 2G & 3G respec.). Go toAdvanced System Settings | Performance | Advanced (virtual mem) ... you have to restart afterwards.2. I can't get this to hibernate (an annoyance when traveling). However HIBERFIL.SYS still exists. I got an extra 1.5GB by disabling hiberneration with this command (run from the command prompt as an administrator or power shell):powercfg.exe /hibernate off"
"42","ASUS E410 Intel Celeron","Amazon Customer","December 8, 2024",4,"Good with Linux","I got this for running Lubuntu, it worked great on first try, Wi-Fi is recognized etc. There is a spare m2 slot which i used to plug in a 512gb card for installing Linux, which leaves windows intact. I'll update the review if I encounter issues. After initial couple of hours it looks perfectly workable for Internet browsing, banking, Google docs, LibreOffice etc. I am sure Windows would be slow with 4gb memory, but i don't plan to find out. Battery life was not a criteria for me, and i have not checked it yet."

I love this laptop even though it does lack in speed and doesn’t have that much storage. I had to get rid of Lenovo Thinkpad which was extremely fast so I feel like every electronic I touch has to have that same standard. Even though it’s not as fast, I still love how lightweight it is and it does get the job done. For the price I paid for it, I definitely would recommend it."

"45","ASUS E410 Intel Celeron","Amber","August 26, 2024",4.2,"Best budget laptop","Over the years Chromebooks have dominated the low cost laptop market. This offering from ASUS provides those that need or prefer a Windows OS an option for that at an incredibly attractive price. While the components are quite low end, you can't ignore the fact that it is an incredible value for the price point. While you won't be doing much intense computing or gaming on this device, it does make for a terrific starter laptop for children. It could also be a good option for those that just want to check email, web browse, and do basic computing on a very lightweight and portable device.Pros: - The bargain basement price. - Decent audio. - Very lightweight and sized perfectly for portability. - A trackpad that doubles as a NUM pad. Very cool idea. - A full HD screen.Cons: Storage is limited but you can use external storage if needed."

"47","ASUS E410 Intel Celeron","Kimi","August 29, 2024",4,"Well Put Together","The designe of the laptop gives it a sleek look that belies its entry level price point. The thin prodile and dark finish makes for an appealing looking laptop. Once you get your hands on it you can feel that the entire chassis is made out of lihgtweight material. The performance matches what i would expect out of an entry level machine device. There isn't going to be a lot of extra bandwidth for heavy multitasking, but things like light web browsing and word documents are well within the capability of this device."

You cant even play simple games like roblox, the material feels cheap and looks cheap. The resolution is bad, but for just work it's pretty powerful. Just make sure to turn off S mode. I wouldn't buy this if I were you. Unless its strictly for work. I also suggest getting a refurbished Mac air 2013 , old but runs better and looks better than this."
"64","HP Stream 14"" HD","Kenneth Stuart","May 25, 2024",4.1,"Reset PC, Switch out of S Mode, Do Not Install McAfee","Windows S Mode and McAfee are glitchy performance killers and restrictive applications.  Switching out of Win 11 S mode should be a straight forward process but it just does not work as it should, along with McAfee installed, whether you want it or not.  McAfee acts like a worm virus, intrusively imbedding itself deep into system architecture instead of being a gate keeper like other anti-virus apps.  Windows S Mode dose not allow you to install and run any app that is not Microsoft verified and found on the Microsoft Store.  In S Mode, you cannot install and run any browser other than MS Edge or Bing.  There is an app within the MS Store to switch out of S mode but it will not work because, I suspect, of the bloated software that launches when you first turn on and set up this laptop.  Switching out of S Mode is permanent.  All the advise and direction I found to get this switch to work had failed.  Lots of frustrated people out there with the same issue.  I finally got MS Support on the phone and they told me this is a very common problem with this product and the only way to resolve it was to reset the PC.  A total reset, wiping the OS and all files you may have added.  No big deal as this is a new PC and I did not transfer anything from my old PC.  After the PC was reset, I was able to switch out of S mode so that I now have Win 11 Home instead of Win 11S Home.  At the same time, a McAfee install popup was automatically prompted so I could select Do Not Install.  This was all a bit of a pain but other than that, this laptop is not so bad.  The display colors are not as vibrant as I hoped but with a resolution of only 1365 x 768, I should have expected that.  However, the graphics display very well on a connected higher resolution monitor and it handles steaming video from Amazon Prime Video beautifully.  I hope this information can help someone avoid the frustration of dealing with what was intentionally sold as a very restrictive operating environment.  Getting rid of S Mode and McAfee gives you back unrestricted use of your laptop.One more annoying detail is that, by default, this operating environment is set to save everything to the MS cloud. The default storage of Document, Downloads, Pictures, etcetera, are all MS cloud folders which is where every file is stored unless you go through a few more clicks to store the files on your local laptop drive.  By default, initially you cannot even boot up this laptop without entering your MS PIN to log onto your laptop, and thereby logging into your MS account at the same time.  I found this a bit presumptuous that MS thought this was a good idea.  Perhaps good for their own marketing efforts though, as some bot scans your files for things you do in order to tailor marketing ad pushes to you personally, but I digress.  If you do not want Big Brother holding on to all your personal, professional, private, or other data, then you need to go in to system settings and turn off the MS log in PIN.  Doing so allows you to boot up your laptop to your local drive account only.  You can always log in and log out of your MS account if and when you choose at any time.  Of course, you can even turn off your own laptop log in password so it just simply turns on. without a password.  Your choice, as it should be."

"82","Dell Inspiron Touchscreen Laptop","Amazon Customer","June 21, 2024",4,"Does the Job","Nice labtop for what it is. My Acer is like 15 years old and I needed a new computer for Nursing school. Storage and speed wide, this does the job.Only had it since 6/15/24, and had to buy a cooling stand (6/19/24) already because it gets hot. Also, the battery dies fast. Unplugged at 100% and 3 hours into school work it said low battery 19%. Will have to carry the cooling stand and charger with me on school nights.Another odd quirk, I've have to reset the time almost everytime I sign in. It's either an hour ahead or an hour behind. It's on the correct time zone (EST) and I've played with the daylight saving toggle and manually reset the time to correct the time, but once it's closed and turned back on, it's a different time.Should be good enough to get me through the next 2 years of nursing school, though."

"85","Dell Inspiron Touchscreen Laptop","Hannah Wallace","November 22, 2024",4,"Keyboard is a nightmare!","Before I purchased this I read reviews that said the keyboard was really hard to adjust to. I thought, ""How bad can it be?"" Let me tell you, BAD!!! Not only does the numeric pad shift the entire keyboard too far to the left of center, but the pad buttons for scrolling and maneuvering around stick, so you try to do a spreadsheet or document and it's suddenly highlighting and shifting things you arent moving, and you cannot easily use the up/down buttons to locate your place because it gets stuck on the function the pad is stuck on. It is the most frustrating laptop I have ever had.In addition, the framework feels so cheap and several other keys are much smaller than a standard keyboard to make room for the numeric pad. I thought I'd get used to it. I thought it would be fine. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this laptop. It slows me down so much because I cannot get used to the positioning of the entire keyboard, or the smaller keys that are difficult to use or not in the same position of every other keyboard. The worst! It is such a Dell disappointment and now I am stuck with it for a while."

The device boasts a metal skin, providing a decent build quality, and a colorful IPS display.

I first need to preface this by saying that I got this to replace an older Macbook… different operating systems has been tough to manage but that’s not an issue related to laptop/hardware itself.This thing is great for the money.  Compared to my old Macbook pro, specs are similar but I have always used macOS so I still prefer that to this one.That being said, I’m still giving it 5 stars because for the price and NOT comparing it to my Macbook, it is fantastic.  This thing is super fast and all around really powerful.  I do not do any gaming so I can’t speak to its performance for that but it easily aces general use (browsing, streaming, etc).Took a gamble going for this laptop and still getting acclimated to Windows but so far extremely happy with the performance."

I've only had this for a couple weeks, but since it's a new product I figure some may still find my thoughts useful. I paid $400, and everything in this review is written with that in mind. The body is powder-coated aluminum and looks pretty sleek. There aren't any glaring MALLRACE letters plastered over it, and the logo is sleek and nondescript. From a looks perspective, there is nothing to reveal that this is a budget device, so long as you perhaps remove the AMD stickers.Speaking of which, mine shipped with Intel's N95 processor, though the product page now specifies N97. It also shipped with some AMD stickers which is pretty humorous and does make me question the device's QC, but it so far seems solid. It has 16GB of RAM and a 500GB SSD. It has WiFi5, BT 5.0, 1080p screen resolution, an unremarkable camera and speakers, two USB-A- ports, a power-only USB-C port, a separate, data USB-C port, HDMI port, 3.5mm headphone jack, and even a microSD slot, along with charging and power status LED indicators along the left side.The screen has a non-glossy, anti-glare coating and is plenty usable in a bright office environment. It's probably not bright enough to stand up to direct sunlight very well, however. The palmrest edges of the laptop are somewhat rounded, and don't dig into the skin as much as some other laptops (*cough* mac *cough*). The keyboard is a chiclet-style scissor switch membrane keyboard as is typical among laptops, but thankfully has full-size up and down arrow keys and a dedicated numpad, though their positioning of the two is condensed. The laptop charges via USB-C and comes with a pretty small power adapter. It's probably realistic to run it off of some battery banks for more power on-the-go. It can balance on its own on the front and back edges with the screen closed, and can be opened with one hand, though the body does lift with the screen for a bit before returning to the table surface.It's pre-installed with Windows 11 Home Edition and doesn't have any manufacturer bloatware pre-installed that I could find. The combination of all these fit my use-case of an unassuming and functional laptop that didn't break the bank."

I've been needing a laptop for awhile to handle all of my business needs. I like to keep my personal things separate from my work and this laptop has fulfilled all of my expectations.

i have been using the laptop for a bit and very impress with the value and will upgrade the review.i was doing research on getting a new laptop to replace my old laptop, came across this laptop, its not the least expensive, but the spec looks good, the cpu is adequate for my computing needs, it might not be able to handle the high intensive gaming out there, but for me to run a couple of games and the office suite, its sufficient.

That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop."
"162","acer Aspire 3 A315-24PT-R0UX","Amazon Customer","August 10, 2024",4.2,"Everything I was looking for","Pretty good laptop. Will make a really good school or low level gaming laptop compared to latest games.It came with a 128gb 800mbps m.2 drive that was slow for windows 11 so upgraded it to 1tb 3500mbps m.2 drive. There are mixed reviews and info even from the manufacturer on if it has a extra ram slot or not but this one does not have one. All the ram is soldered to the motherboard and needs to be taken to an Acer shop in order to upgrade. Out of the box it used 6/8gb of ram at first then after the updates it dropped down to 4/8gb used. The system is pretty fast for only having 4gb free. The processor is the main feature I ordered it for since it is a 4core-8thread processor with speed ranging from 2.5ghz to 4.3ghz. After trying some more power demanding games the temp could still not pass 50c and stays quiet and cool to touch. It normally stays idle around 41c when not under a heavy load with no sound from the fans. The screen is decent quality but not meant for games since it's LCD and not being led the games get a bit of blur here and there with higher fps. Word of advice is when installing a different operating system the WiFi drivers do not reinstall with the system so any online activation is almost useless unless you have a usb-ethernet adapter. The battery lasts me around 6 hours in performance mode but in power saving mode could possibly last 9+ hours and way longer with some power setting tweaks. The graphics says 600mb dedicated and 3400mb shared but unlike a lot of systems all the shared moves straight to dedicated making it 4gb for the graphics. The value is pretty good and the appearance is slick. My older brother was checking it out and thinking of buying one now because of how well it does. Some upgrades to look into if you know what your doing is a new m.2 drive with a faster transfer rate and also possibly an upgraded 15.6inch screen that's 1080p-4k."

No matter what I did, I couldn't get it to do 2 things at once.  Download a game OR play some music OR browse the web, but never twice at once- Windows 11 in S-Mode.  Need I say more?  It was a nightmare to downgrade from S-Mode, but once it was done, Win11 doesn't seem all that bad, although it does take up a large chunk of the SSD.- Small SSD at only 128G in a time when a 500G drive is only $50.

Fischer","January 29, 2024",4,"Excellent computer","I bought this laptop refurbished as a backup for my primary (and increasingly unreliable) older Windows laptop. I have had nothing but good experiences with ASUS laptops.Pros: 1) Easy to use for most apps out of the box; 2) Adaptive options (I need visual adaptations); 3) Chrome OS is stable; Excellent camera for video calls (I didn't have to balance this laptop on a box.); 4) fast and no hang ups.Cons:1) Not all Android apps work on the Chrome OS. Microsoft 365 apps can only be used in the online versions which lack some functionality, although Microsoft has recently added features; 2) Initially, the computer wouldn't let me log in. I had to reset the operating system to be able to initially log in; 3) the computer is very sensitive to the strength of your wi-fi network.If you want to use Microsoft 365 apps on this computer, don't install OneDrive or any MS Word related extensions for the Chrome browser. Any of these will prevent MS 365 apps from running online.All in all, an excellent general purpose laptop."

I'm looking through when I see Asus, ""ooh, I like them!"" Have lactas products for a long time, ever since I bought a little netbook back in 2008... I bought most of their phones, admittedly there's zenfone 9 was less than ideal.. But surely that was a fluke right?I like to do art... Writing, actual drawing... Things like that. I don't do that on my normal computer cuz I will completely sidetrack myself...So my old Chromebook died. This was the choice... It finally came in and I was so excited to finally get started. Oh, it comes with a mouse! I thought that was unusual, I guess I should have taken that as a red flag.By the time I had logged into my Gmail account, I had figured out that this phone doesn't have a touch screen. I haven't even tried anything beyond this, I can't believe they're still making Chromebooks like this... It blows my mind... Bad enough when I'm at work and I try to hit the screen to make something happen, and forget I have to use my mouse... Not doing that at home."

This is more like a very large Android phone. It's perfect for what it does. Surfing the internet, checking email, looking at your google photos. If you understand this, and it is in fact something you need, it'll be perfect for you."

Been using it for lightweight web browsing and email and the battery life is really great! it’s one of the cheaper chromebook with a usb-c port charger which was convenient to charge. The rugged material is a bonus too"
