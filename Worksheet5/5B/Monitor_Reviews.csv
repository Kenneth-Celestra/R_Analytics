"1","Amazon Basics 24 Inch","","October 12, 2024",4.3,"Great budget monitor","Straight out the box with no calibration it has amazing colors and great contrast with some decent built in speakers although most will probably play with headphones anyways. Also at its prime day special of $36 it is unbelievable to think how good it is for the price"

"3","Amazon Basics 24 Inch","Rodrigo Gonzalez","November 19, 2024",4.3,"Great budget monitors, works like a charm","Great budget monitors, works like a charm. If you are wfh like me, this is it. Nothing fancy but gets the job done."
"4","Amazon Basics 24 Inch","FunWithAmazon","October 17, 2024",4.3,"Good Monitor for The Price","It's a good monitor for the price. Mine came with a small scratch that is barely noticeable but other than that it works perfectly fine. A key feature that makes this even more valuable is the internal speakers that my other monitor does not have. If you want a simple monitor then this will get the job done."

"8","Amazon Basics 24 Inch","Jun","October 23, 2024",4.6,"Decent quality for office use","The monitor is great for the price, but I wouldn't use it as a gaming monitor because of the 4ms response time. The colors all look great though and would work as an office monitor for regular use or watching videos. It doesn't get too bright but it's expected from a monitor of this price. Overall a decent monitor."

Tried the various display settings on the panel. So either poor picture quality or my panel is defective. I have initiated a return."
"10","Amazon Basics 24 Inch","Marcus","October 5, 2024",4.3,NA,"very simple, nice and easy montior. open up, easy to carry. click it in and you are ready to use it. no fear or damaging because the price is so good even at its original price. and its 100 hz. with 27 inch monitor its not necessary to use 4k in it. so i would say 1080p is the right resolution. cheers amazon! keep making them"

"24","Gaming Monitor 27 Inch","Ismael Cortez","April 3, 2024",4.5,"Surprised","This thing is surprisingly nice. I've been using it as a gaming monitor on a laptop with an RTX 4060 and this thing keeps up exceptionally well. The overall image quality is a bit lackluster, but there is hardly any ghosting or color bleed. The brightness is pretty intense and the refresh rate seems accurate. It's not quite as smooth feeling as a monitor 5x the price, but it does perform admirably for the price range it's in. If you need a starter/basic gaming monitor and aren't overly concerned with the super fine details (i.e. you play a lot of high-motion games), this will do a fantastic job.Amazing starter gaming monitor. Definitely worth the money. Just don't expect great performance if you use it for productivity."
"25","Gaming Monitor 27 Inch","Poison","November 29, 2023",4.5,"No audio support","This monitor looked good right out of the box when connected to my computer.  I really didn't need to adjust any of the settings (brightness, contrast, etc.) However, I did try some of the settings just to see what effect they would have.  I found that the ECO setting had the biggest effect.  The PC looked great on Standard but streaming video looked better on the Movie setting.  These settings usually come down to what looks best to the user but there are enough settings available for most users to find what looks best to them. FreeSync is available for gamers, which I am not, so I didn't test it.The monitor has a fairly wide viewing angle.  I was able to view from 45 degrees off center and still see a decent image.  It supports both HDMI and Display Port inputs. The website description says it supports high quality audio and the Onscreen menu does show settings for audio volume and muting but I was unable to get any sound from it.  There's no mention of audio or speakers in any of the provided documentation and, frankly, I wasn't expecting it to have audio when I ordered it.  I suspect the same Onscreen Menu is used for other models which do have audio support."
"26","Gaming Monitor 27 Inch","Nong","January 29, 2024",4.3,"A Solid 1080P Gaming Monitor","The INFIEVO 27 Inch 1080P Gaming Monitor, is a good, all-around piece of tech that I use every day. In fact, I'm using it now as part of a multi-monitor setup, and am really loving the 180Hz refresh rate, and the speedy 1ms response time.Both are important when it comes to competitive gaming and getting the bead on the bad guy. I have it connected via HDMI, but there are also other connection options included with the unit. This is a solid workhorse of a monitor, and one that I would recommend to fit your 1080P gaming (and office) needs."
"27","Gaming Monitor 27 Inch","Gabe P.","December 7, 2023",3.9,"Excellent monitor for gaming or daily use!","I got this monitor to replace a smaller Dell monitor I had been using the past few years. This monitor is very nice. The picture is nice and clear. The size is excellent! I got the 27"". I don't really game much so mainly got it for general work I do on the computer. I did test a few games on it though, and the clarity, smoothness and design were all way better than anything I had used before.Setup was super simple and I was using it within 15  minutes of unboxing. The price point for this monitor is super. I would  recommend this!"
"28","Gaming Monitor 27 Inch","EverNoticeThat","November 30, 2023",4.5,"Short power cord","The monitor is nice and easy to set up. My only complaint is the length of the power cord. It is only 40” long so your workstation needs to be close to an outlet or you need a power strip. It is thin and light weight"
"29","Gaming Monitor 27 Inch","Aimcat","January 10, 2024",4.5,NA,"L'écran est super en terme de qualité, mais c'est surtout au niveau des accessoires qu'il y a des légers defauts.Pour le fixer sur un support Vesa, la cavité à l'arrière de l'écran où l'on vis la plaquette qui se rattache au support est trop petite et ne ""fit"" pas avec les vis fournies lorsqu'on achete un support vesa.Le cable d'alimentation est court, donc si vous avez un bureau ajustable, il faudra le changer pour un plus long ou une rallonge! Sur un bureau non ajustable la longueur est assez longue si la prise électrique n'est pas trop loin."

"41","Sceptre New 27-inch Gaming","","December 1, 2024",4.5,"Beautiful display","I have two of these set up in a dual monitor display very very please with them, well packaged, arrived on time ease set up, no problems, purchased as part of black Friday deal...got a GREAT price on both!!!"
"42","Sceptre New 27-inch Gaming","Amazon Customer","October 28, 2024",4.6,"It’s a monitor - nothing exceptional, but nothing wrong either","This product came super fast with Amazon Prime. One-day delivery.This monitor hooks up with my MacBook Air with a USB C Dongle. The picture isn’t that crisp but it is good enough. It functions great for Netflix, Amazon Video or other streaming services.It’s great for gaming. I have this monitor hooked up to my PS4 and the picture quality is amazing. I play Red Dead Redemption 2 and I frequently stop to admire the details in the water and snow. I’m not sure if this is due to the quality of the monitor or the game.It’s relatively easy to set up once you get it out of the box. It comes with a power cord and HDMI inside the box. There are 2 HDMI ports on the back so you could hook up a computer and another device.What I like about this monitor is that I don’t have to switch inputs from PS4 to my MacBook. When I disconnect my MacBook, the monitor detects the PS4 connection and automatically changes it. When my PS4 is off and I connect my MacBook the monitor instantly connects.The speakers suck though. They are quiet. They have no bass either.I paid roughly 88 dollars with tax for this screen and it was a good deal. Just keep in mind this is a 1080P screen so it’s not as good quality as a 1440p or 4k screen. Keep your expectations low. It’s a good secondary screen or a gaming device. It’s not great for photo or video editing if you want something with super high definition."
"43","Sceptre New 27-inch Gaming","Martin Stearns","July 23, 2024",4.5,"Great value, perfect for college students","This monitor is a great value for college students, for an office, or budget/beginner gaming computer. The color quality is not great compared to more expensive monitors tailored for gaming, but it is not a serious problem and it works great for the price. The best part about this monitor is the compact packaging and it is lightweight. You are provided with two screws and a screwdriver, which screws on the back of the monitor neck to hold the monitor in place. To disassemble, you just take out those screws, you can put everything back in the foam, and slide it back in the box. Then, you can carry the box easily under one arm. That’s why this is the perfect monitor for college move-ins/outs or anyone on the move with a monitor. I need two hands to carry the box of my more expensive Acer Nitro gaming monitor, but not this one. Finally, no computer monitor speakers are high quality, so don’t expect a rock concert coming out of any monitor speakers. They are just fine."
"44","Sceptre New 27-inch Gaming","Timothy Wong","December 4, 2024",4.5,"Good price and great quality","I purchased one of these to be my secondary monitor, it has a very good picture, was light weight and easy to set up. I even bought my wife one of these for her to use as the price was so good compared to the quality I received."
"45","Sceptre New 27-inch Gaming","Andrew","December 7, 2024",4.4,"Excellent monitor at a reasonable price","Very nice display for the price.  My only complaint is that the audio is poor.  But I don't plan to use it for audio."
"46","Sceptre New 27-inch Gaming","Jeremey Hall","August 21, 2024",4.6,"Fantastic Monitor for Gaming and Everyday Use","This 27-inch Sceptre monitor has been a great addition to my setup. The 100Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time make gaming super smooth, with no noticeable lag. The colors are vibrant, and the 100% sRGB coverage really makes everything pop, whether I'm gaming or working on design projects.The frameless design looks sleek on my desk, and the multiple ports (two HDMI and one DisplayPort) make it easy to switch between my PC and console. The built-in speakers are a nice touch—good enough for casual use, though I still prefer my external speakers for serious gaming.One of the best features for me is the eye care technology. I spend long hours in front of the screen, and this monitor significantly reduces eye strain. The AMD FreeSync works flawlessly, ensuring smooth, tear-free gameplay.Overall, this monitor is a steal for the price. It’s perfect for anyone looking for a solid, affordable option that performs well across the board."
"47","Sceptre New 27-inch Gaming","chris c","December 6, 2024",4.5,"I'm super happy with this Monitor","I'm a visual artist (an oil painter). I have been using a television monitor hooked up to my computer to enlarge photo references to paint from. The television finally gave up so I replaced it with this monitor. I thought it would be a snap to set up, but honestly, it was frustrating as heck. I'm not a techno-phobe, but I'm not all that savvy and the instruction booklet did not spell everything out. Eventually I called the 1-800 number provided. The first surprise is that I called in early evening and a real person answered within minutes. The support guy was REALLY good, patient and clear. Within a few minutes the new monitor was up and running...and it is amazing! Fabulous color...I'm 100% happy with the monitor *and* with customer service."

"51","Sceptre New 27-inch Gaming","fahad","October 19, 2020",5,NA,"Great product, the visuals are amazing. I use this monitor for gaming and it runs smoother than my tv. What sets this monitor aside from most monitors is that it has an input audio and output audio source which is pretty awesome because I can just plug my headphones into the monitor and hear everything clearly. The audio on its own is not the greatest without headphones as I’m used to the surround sound system on my tv, however if you put headphones into the monitor, the sound is perfect. In terms of the audio without headphones, I had difficulty trying to distinguish where enemies were during games based on their footsteps, however when I put headphones in, I was able to properly distinguish where people were. So I’m conclusion, it’s an amazing product and definitely worth your money, but if you’re gonna use it for gaming, make sure you have headphones or another audio input !!"

"61","acer KB272 G0bi 27""","Andrew Furst","July 5, 2023",4.6,"Awesome for the price and my uses","These reviews are mixed together; I have the 27"" IPS 100hz version.  I use the HDMI (digital) port for connection, but it's nice that this monitor also has a VGA (analog) input option as VGA is a past standard for older computers.  To my eyes the brightness and colors are great right out of the box, and the picture is very clear.  I don't play fast-action video games, so I can't comment on how well it works for those.  But for text, spreadsheets, and normal web browsing (including YouTube) this works very well.Positives:IPS (for me) is preferable to VA type monitors.  It's a small difference but if you are picky, here's IPS.The border is very thin, thus you've got maximum usable screen space with almost no waste.The price was incredible at $120.  I see that it's now $160 and I think still a good value there.Great picture right out of the box.VESA wall (or arm) mountable.Choice of HDMI or VGA input.Looks good with the power on or off.Potential negatives (for some people):Provided base is very wide at the bottom, and possibly difficult to attach to monitor.  I tried briefly to attach the screen to the base, instructions say something about turning it to attach securely - I couldn't figure out how to attach it securely.  This didn't matter to me because I planned to use a ""monitor arm"" (I have one from MOUNTUP) and that works great on my computer desk which is about 1"" thick.  But if you want to use the included base, I'm not sure how to attach it securely, and I might ding it a star for that.The AC to DC power convertor (aka power supply) is inside the monitor, which gives it an elegant look vs. a separate power supply.  However, if the power supply dies, good luck replacing it.  At the price paid this is ok, and might even be preferable for some people.The power cord and connections to the computer (HDMI or VGA) attach upward from the bottom, rather than straight into the back.  Again this looks more elegant but I would prefer straight into the back, as that is easier to attach.  You might need to do some fumbling around before you get it all connected.The monitor is adjustable for brightness, colors, on/off etc. from the back of the unit on the right side.  These are easily reached by ""feel"" once you know where they are, and which is which.  One of the switches starts an on-screen ""menu"" that you can navigate.  I made it appear but haven't tried to adjust it.  This is probably how all monitors adjust now, but I preferred the old days when monitors had 5 or so physical switches on the front or bottom edge, so you could change brightness, color hue, etc.  Of course those monitors were also much more expensive than today's monitors, for a smaller picture that wasn't as good as today's.  Just saying that if you want to change the settings, it may take some fumbling to get the hang of it.It doesn't have the pixel density of more expensive monitors, but for my use I don't need it the higher density.  To me the picture and text looks really good from where I sit, which is about 2 feet away.Overall this is fantastic for my uses as a VESA-mounted non-gaming monitor, and incredible at the price I paid.  The only frustration I can imagine is if you use the included base/stand and can't figure out how to secure it to the screen (there must be a way, I would think, but I didn't try very hard since I was going to use an external ""arm"" mount anyway).  Or if you do fast-action gaming, maybe it's not as good as some, but I have no idea about that."

"82","27 inch Gaming Monitor","Amazon Customer","October 6, 2024",4.3,"Absolutely love it! 😇","I bought this last year (2023) around September and it’s still holding up! This absolute gem is one of favorite purchases. The screen is crystal clear, it runs smoothly and fast, no flickering or glitching whatsoever (I use DP instead of HDMI). I will say the speakers on it aren’t great… but that’s fine with me, I usually use my speaker anyway. The little cat ears were a (cute💖) bonus. One only fell off once and I stuck it back on there and it hasn’t moved since 🤷🏾‍♀️ It’s a little on the heavy side so be careful. If something were to happen to this one I’d probably buy another one since I love this one so much."

If your laptop or other device doesn't show up in the monitor, try checking the drivers on your laptop first. It might not be the monitor's fault, but rather an issue with your other device."

I’m not using the stand, but I checked it out and liked it a lot. It has a ring of colored led lights on the back that create a cool effect. Resolution is awesome and response time is fast.

"104","KTC 32 Inch Curved","Metalcase","November 28, 2024",4.5,"Amazing Monitor","I did a lot of research on budge Ultrawide monitors  before buying this Monitor, actually based on reviews purchased a couple prior including the last purchase which was the Sansui 34"" Ultrawide monitor which was total crap.  Picture quality was just to bad to ignore and still trying to understand the decent reviews it got.What led me to this one was a couple of reviews and upon research found that KTC actually made OEM panels for Samsung.  So with that thought and the specs I thought why not give it a try.  I was totally blown away after a few tweaks the picture quality is amazing.  I basically use for gaming but with the quality i'm sure it can handle some editing.I'm not a monitor guru but do understand marketing.  I can assure you this monitor is worth well more than listed price and that where marketing comes in.  Drop the price for Black Friday, Sale 1000's at this price and Bam then comes awesome reviews and once the reviews start happening you're going to see a huge price Hike.So my advise is to get this Baby while you can before this happens I assure you that this monitor could easily sale for $600 once reviews start hitting!"

"121","KTC 24 inch Monitor","","December 1, 2024",4.4,"a good budget-friendly monitor","I bought this during a pre-Black Friday sale: an Amazon ""Lightening Deal"" combined with a KTC coupon that dropped the price well below $200. So, my positive response to the H32S17 is partly based on the big discount I got for my purchase.The monitor is the advertised 32 inch width. The bezels are very small, about 2 mm; however, the panel has a small, black border, which is never utilized. So the border around the display area extends another 5 mm around the left, right, and top. So, the max viewing area, measured by the diagonal corners is 31.5 inches.The build quality is solid plastic for the monitor, and the monitor base does use metal. I can't speak to the amount of adjustment the monitor has on its base since I have mine on a 3rd-party VESA mount. The 1500R curvature is very gentle. I use the monitor up close and viewing content from a distance up to 10 feet away, and the curvature isn't annoying. Be aware, since the panel is a VA, the viewing angles aren't as wide as with an IPS or OLED panel. But there is some viewing angle, especially if you are viewing content from a bigger distance. You don't need to be directly dead center in front of the monitor to get a good viewing experience.The out-of-the-box calibration of H32S17 is not good. You will have to adjust such things like the color hue, saturation, gamma, brightness, and contrast to fit your environment. Some have complained that VA panels aren't very bright. I'm happy with the brightness of this monitor. I never have the brightness maxed out, and I often lower it to 85 - 75% depending on what I'm watching and how dark my office is at any given time. When I finally got it adjusted, the display is vibrant with good color saturation and deep blacks.This wasn't clear when I researched the monitor, so I will confirm that the H32S17 has an overdrive mode that has 4 different speeds. I currently have it on the highest speed, but all the levels do influence the gray-to-gray response times differently. So, this monitor, like any VA, will have some black smearing, but the overdrive, plus the high refresh rate, will mitigate it some. I'm satisfied with the low level of smearing, but I don't play high-level FPS games where smearing would cause problems.I do use the monitor for productivity. Text clarity is very good, whether reading black text on white backgrounds or white text on black backgrounds. I was a little concerned about that when I bought the monitor, but it has exceeded my expectations in this aspect.If you have a decent PC and GPU that can push high frame rates, I recommend connecting the monitor to your GPU with the display port. With a DP connection, the monitor provides a stable 180 frames, which is even higher than the advertised 165-170 hz. I'm extremely happy with that.Overall, this is a budget-friendly monitor that is good for multiple purposes (viewing content, casual gaming, and productivity). It won't compare to the best IPS and OLED monitors, but, for what I paid, I believe I got a quality product."
"122","KTC 24 inch Monitor","Amazon Customer","November 20, 2024",4.4,"Great monitor works perfectly with a Mac Mini","I got this to upgrade an aging 1080p monitor I was using and the upgraded resolution is amazing. The colors are bright and crisp. It’s like using a new computer.I mostly use the computer for office type work. The 2k resolution is so much better than 1080. Type is clear. The large size is great and can easily replace two 1080 monitors.I don’t game with this monitor but video looks great.It does lack a speaker and the monitor controls are a little finicky, but once you get it set up, it turns on and off with the computer automatically.This is a good monitor for the price."
"123","KTC 24 inch Monitor","Anthony Z","October 16, 2024",4.4,"Very nice monitor","I was looking for a 1080p 165hz+ to play some fps.  I have a 32 inch 1440p and a 28 inch 4k that are very nice as well.  The 32 inch 1440p does 144hz with vrr.  But the 4k is on 60hz.I had read up on this and noticed that the only review I found on this said the monitor would not do vrr with hdmi.  I was going to use display port anyway and with the discount and % off it was decently below $100.  Took the chance.This monitor honestly looks way better than I thought it would.  Colors are great.  My 32 inch is a Dell that reviews very well and has nice color.  It is calibrated.  And this looks really good compared to that.  As good?  No.  But really good.Not only that but the 24 inch screen does not over pixelate like I thought it might.I played some games over display port and the monitor had no issues.  No tearing, no lag, not noticeable ghosting, or any of that.  Ghosting bothers me which is why I gave my wife my a 1440p VA monitor I had.  Looked great until the action started.  And it messed with me.The refresh rate combined with vrr worked like it should.  But what about hdmi.  The monitor comes with an HDMI cable.  But I did not use that.  I used a nice ultra high speed hdmi I already had laying here.First, I tested on Xbox Series X.  It did show vrr.  Allowed 120hz.  And the monitor was showing this.  I did Fortnite which has some drops here and there and even with those odd drops it has to the 90s for me it was smooth.  Though mostly it stuck right near 120.  But it did allow vrr and 120hz over hdmi.On to pc.  I hooked the same HDMI to my PC and it was showing 60hz.  I went into AMD Adrenaline and toggled on VRR.  Then I went to Windows settings and changed the Hz to 180.  All good.  Windows, AMD, and this monitor (H25T7) all show 180Hz.  I then did a game test.I jumped on PUBG as that game has frame drops and is all over for me on all my systems.  This particular PC however does not have stutter I have seen on other PCs though.  The frame rate in lobby was showing over 400.  But that is static basically.  In the game this FPS was anywhere from 92 (lowest) to over 200.  Was mostly around 160 Hz.  I did not notice any issues.  It was smooth as you could want.Overall I was surprised by this monitor at this price.  I was on the fence about taking the chance.  But then I figured if the ghosting was bad or vrr did not work well I would just use it as a monitor for chats and such.Note:  Windows automatically put his monitor as a 10-bit panel.  And so did AMD Adrenaline.  I did not mess with those.  So the color settings are at 10-bit RGB 4:4:4 Full."
"124","KTC 24 inch Monitor","Brian J Lambert","September 16, 2024",4.4,"Amazing buy for this price","I’m only a week or so into using this monitor, but so far I am very pleased with its performance. 4 stars instead of 5 because regardless of what they say, Gsync won’t really be an option. KTC people: Just saying you’re Gsync compatible and allowing me to check a box in the GeForce config menu doesn’t mean it’s really working. Through a pretty wide variety of games I still see screen tearing that’s pretty noticeable. If I use the game’s vsync option I immediately notice the absence of tearing of any kind. I have another 34” Alienware ultrawide and this one isn’t as good as that one, but it’s closer than you’d think!This being a VA panel instead of IPS means nice blacks. Images looked great with very minimal tweaking.  I feel like it gets plenty bright.  I’d definitely recommend buying this monitor for PC gaming."
"125","KTC 24 inch Monitor","Crazy Logic Error","November 14, 2024",4.4,NA,"I purchased this on sale for only $180 cad which is insane value considering it’s:- 27” 1440p- 180 Hz- Has an IPS panel, not the VA junk- Low response times, very minimal if any ghosting- Gsync compatible- advertised brightness is 350 nits, but compared to my HP 27Xi which is also a 350 not monitor it’s a tiny bit dimmer maybe realistically around 300 nits which is plenty bright enough for most peopleThe only negative I found with this monitor is that they cheaped out on the stand as there’s no height adjustment or swivel nothing fancy only tilt adjustment.

My previous monitor uses DisplayPort which this monitor lacks. This typically isn't a problem with 100mhz monitors as HDMI caps out around 144mhz. Gaming was relatively smooth with minimal artifacts, although at high pan speeds, digitizing was prominent. The lack of height adjustment means you will have to change your desktop to get the correct height. The monitor does have VESA mounting holes so an articulated wall mount would be a good option.

Splendor!","Bought this for Helldivers 2.Pros:  Beautiful, cost effective.  24"", 1080p, 180Hz refresh.  Looks great to me.  Helldivers 2 looks fantastic, glad I upgraded from my 60Hz 22"" screen.  has VESA mounts if you need them.  Fraction of the cost of an equal quality 4k gaming screen.Cons:1. Not 4k.2. Build quality is flimsy for a monitor.  I can slightly flex it by adjusting the tilt on it, has not damaged the screen.  Despite this, it is good enough to use for the daily, but I wouldn't travel with it unless it was wrapped in bubble wrap and/or a sturdy case.3. It defaulted to 60Hz refresh out of the box.  Took about 1.5 hours of tweaking over two days to get the settings right.  No real instructions on how to get the 180Hz refresh working properly.  For a few hours I had major ghosting issues, but that was a setting I had over-tweaked.  Once I found the right settings, it has been fantastic.  I may have over-complicated the setup.Thoughts:  Great screen, light duty build.  I'd buy it again."
"184","acer Nitro 24.5"" Full","Elias","November 9, 2024",5,"Decent monitor","I mainly purchased this monitor because it seemed easier on my eyes than some other LED-lit monitors I tested. Still not as good as an older CCFL but not awful either. The coating is somewhat annoying as there's a slight blurriness and grey/blue glare with off viewing angles due to it. I'm not sure if that's due to VA tech or Acer's choice for coating.There is no PWM flickering at all. The settings menu has a very thorough set of options which I appreciate including Hue and Saturation, Gamma, Brightness, Contrast, Blue Light Filter Mode and Overdrive. There's little difference between Overdrive Off and Standard but a large difference with Extreme mode, which does provide great clarity but with clearly visible overshoot artifacts for moving edges.Some of the default settings are not ideal. If Nvidia Control Panel is set to default settings or set to Limited range, black boost should be set to 0 instead of the default 5, but it should be left at 5 if you manually change the Nvidia setting to Full range. Gamma should be set to 2.4 to achieve actual 2.2 gamma. Low Blue Light should be set to level 1 to not go higher than 6500K color temperature. Level 2 is still close enough to 6500K to be usable while also being easier on the eyes. The low blue light setting does seem to change the black/near black color temperature which is good if you are concerned about blue light from the LED backlight.Not a bad purchase for $100 I just wish we had CCFL color temperature backlights again or cheap OLED monitors."
